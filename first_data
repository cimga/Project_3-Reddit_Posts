I e-mailed the air carrier myself (didn't use a legal company to ""represent"" me) and 5 business days later, I was offered a check for almost $700. Feels incredible, I still can't get over it.

My e-mail was probably only four sentences long explaining the situation and stating my rights. I attached a picture of my boarding passes, and that's it. Incredibly simple, yet very effective.

b9uj8o,travel,Maybe solo traveling is nothing for me. Traveling with social anxiety...,"
It is my first day in Budapest after deciding to do my second solo Trip after 4 days in venice. The  Venice travel was really exhausting but i thought it was because it was the first time ever and it was so crowded. I wanted to have another experience, i thought with more time and more variety it would be better...here i am now in Budapest. 4 days to go and then i travel to zagreb where i wanted to spend 5 days.

I feel exhausted and homesick, which i usually never have,  even after just 1 day.  I don't want to see the City or anything, i just want to go home because everything is too much. I did step out of my comfort zone, i managed to get here alone, but now i just feel empty. Maybe this are the symptoms of successfully stepping out of my comfort zone and just a sign that i'm batteling with my social anxiety or  maybe solo travel just isn't my thing. It's so hard to find out the reason to that feeling of extreme unhappiness...

I always admired all the people who solo travel, all their courage, the experiences they make..but maybe i'm just not one of them. 

It's very hard to see it positively right now...","Maybe solo traveling is nothing for me. Traveling with social anxiety...

b9x2cu,travel,X-post from r/roadtrips... Antelope Canyon and time changes?," 

Hi guys! Hoping to get some clarification on an upcoming road trip I’m taking. The entire trip is Milwaukee to Los Angeles, but for this post I’m focusing on Grand Junction, CO to Page, AZ.

My plan is to drive thru Moab, thru Monument Valley, tour Antelope Canyon, then cap it off at Horseshoe Bend. When I put in google maps it tells me destination is in a different time zone. When I called the tour places, they said Arizona doesn’t observe DST but Navajo nations do (so that would include antelope canyon?)

Since you need reservations weeks or months in advance sometimes, I’m really struggling to figure out what time I should book my tour.

If I leave Grand Junction, CO at 7:00am... what time would it be in Page, AZ when I arrive? It’s a six hour drive, plus stopping for food and photos I will add an hour, so seven. Leaving at 7:00am and driving for seven hours puts me at 2:00pm, but is it ACTUALLY only 1:00pm??

Thanks!!","X-post from r/roadtrips... Antelope Canyon and time changes?

I’m looking for pants that stay cool, look stylish, and are flexible and (ideally) sweat-wicking. For reference, I’ve been looking at Kuhl Deceptr pants and Lululemon ABC Slims. Price point is under $100. Obviously, if I’m investing in pants - want to be able to wear them when I’m home in the U.S. - to work, etc.

Re: shoes, I know there are a lot of options. I just am looking for general recs for high arch supportive walking shoes. My last trip to Europe, I wore Lems Boulder Boots - which didn’t do any favors for me knees... I was thinking initially New Balance Fresh Foam Cruz V2’s.

b9wh4y,travel,How to stay budget friendly honeymooning in Iceland?,"Looking for advice on a 10-12 day honeymoon trip to Iceland in June. My fiance and I have been struggling to come to a conclusion on where we will take our honeymoon, and i think we landed on a solid idea, but we want some ideas on what others have done while there?! 

One of our popular ideas at the moment is to rent a motorhome for 6-7 days at least and drive the Ring, and also hike around, take photos, find hotsprings and waterfalls etc! Does anyone have any experience in doing this? If so what all did you learn / pros and cons of this experience.

We would either start or end our trip with a couple days in Reykjavik and have a few ""nice nights out"", and possibly also rent a cabin somewhere for a couple night as well.

Or should we just rent a car / truck, still drive the ring but stay in hotels and other locations along the way? 

What all are your thoughts to hit as much as possible while also staying relatively affordable?

b9xubf,travel,How to hold an American phone number outside of US?,"Hey guys, so I'm American and currently residing in Sofia, Bulgaria. While I'm here, I am still using my American banks and such for everything, and they are of course tied to my phone number. However, for the old numbers I have tied to everything, I don't have access to them. This is mostly because:

\- I was using VOIP apps for a lot of those while I was in the US

\-  The most recent phone number I registered with my bank, I lost its SIM card.

Are there any ways for me to have an American phone number that I can use in Europe to send and receive calls and texts? I know the obvious answer seems like getting service from any US company like Sprint, Verizon, and T-Mobile, but I don't think these options are cheap since their intentional plans are meant for short stays. I am specifically talking about something such as a SIM or phone app that gives me full access to be able to receive and send texts and calls. I am willing to pay a monthly fee. Also, it needs to be something where I can keep the number, and not lose it after inactivity. What's my best/cheapest option?

b9vjpy,travel,Critique my itinerary V2 (esp. where to go in Switzerland),"So I posted last week about a 3.5 week trip, but I've decided to modify the itinerary to include more time in Central Europe by removing the London/Paris from the trip (will do those another time!) Here's my new draft itinerary:

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/b5aiwo2wyhq21.png

My main goals are the following:

1. See my family in northern Italy (Alsessandrio, which is between Milan, Torino, and Genoa), then go to Rome with my cousin the week of 8/26 for 3-4 full days. This is his availability based on school.
2. Fly from Rome to Central Europe, probably Budapest, around 8/30. Spend about 2 weeks in Central Europe. My friend may meet me there. Spend several days (say 4) in Budapest, then travel by train/bus to cities like Bratislava, Vienna, Prague, maybe even as far as Krakow depending. Or I may cut it off at Vienna or Prague just to avoid travel burnout.
3. Fly to Geneva to visit CERN's LHC on Saturday/Sunday 9/14 to 9/15, then fly home from Geneva.

Right now, I'm really trying to figure out where I want to fly into and what to do on the front end of my trip before reaching the family's place. I'm itching to buy my main plane ticket.

Couple other goals...

1. I'm also trying to minimize my (main) plane ticket cost. $1000 would be awesome but $1200-1300 is do-able too. I plan on buying Ryanair, etc. tickets to get around within Europe when not using train/bus.
2. Trying to avoid peak summer crowds. I know Rome will be crowded in August, I don't really have a choice on that one based on cousin's availability, but I am hoping central europe will be more chill in September.
3. I don't want to spend \_all\_ my time in cities. So one consideration was to maybe see some of the swiss alps on the front end of the trip, northern Italy, etc..

I'm really trying to figure out the front end of my trip, IE where to fly into and visit before I make my way to see the family. I was really interested in the Golden Pass and was thinking this would be a cool way to see the Swiss Alps. I could fly into Geneva, then head east by train, taking in some sights along the way. The round trip flight to/from Geneva is about $1200 which isn't too bad.

However I also noted that flying into Lichtenstein, Germany then flying back from Geneva is about $100 cheaper than the round-trip Geneva ticket. I'm sure there are some interesting things up this way too.

Finally, I considered flying into Marsailles, then heading east into Italy along the coast, visting towns as I went, but I decided in August, the French/Italian Riveria would be quite crowded.

Any thoughts on relaxing ways to plan the front end of the trip, like where to fly into and things to do that involve natural beauty would be appreciated, thank you in advance for your thoughts!

&#x200B;","Critique my itinerary V2 (esp. where to go in Switzerland) So I posted last week about a 3.5 week trip, but I've decided to modify the itinerary to include more time in Central Europe by removing the London/Paris from the trip (will do those another time!) Here's my new draft itinerary:

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/b5aiwo2wyhq21.png

My main goals are the following:

1. See my family in northern Italy (Alsessandrio, which is between Milan, Torino, and Genoa), then go to Rome with my cousin the week of 8/26 for 3-4 full days. This is his availability based on school.
2. Fly from Rome to Central Europe, probably Budapest, around 8/30. Spend about 2 weeks in Central Europe. My friend may meet me there. Spend several days (say 4) in Budapest, then travel by train/bus to cities like Bratislava, Vienna, Prague, maybe even as far as Krakow depending. Or I may cut it off at Vienna or Prague just to avoid travel burnout.
3. Fly to Geneva to visit CERN's LHC on Saturday/Sunday 9/14 to 9/15, then fly home from Geneva.

Right now, I'm really trying to figure out where I want to fly into and what to do on the front end of my trip before reaching the family's place. I'm itching to buy my main plane ticket.

Couple other goals...

1. I'm also trying to minimize my (main) plane ticket cost. $1000 would be awesome but $1200-1300 is do-able too. I plan on buying Ryanair, etc. tickets to get around within Europe when not using train/bus.
2. Trying to avoid peak summer crowds. I know Rome will be crowded in August, I don't really have a choice on that one based on cousin's availability, but I am hoping central europe will be more chill in September.
3. I don't want to spend \_all\_ my time in cities. So one consideration was to maybe see some of the swiss alps on the front end of the trip, northern Italy, etc..

I'm really trying to figure out the front end of my trip, IE where to fly into and visit before I make my way to see the family.

b9q7i1,travel,"Traveling from San Francisco (or Carmel) to Los Angeles by car over 2 week period, tips, suggestions appreciated","Hi, we've never been to California and will be flying into SFO, staying for 2 nights there (don't think we need a car in SFO), and then planning on renting a car (or other recommended form of transportation? - to get to Carmel).

Then after about 5 nights in Carmel we'll drive down the Pacific coast highway stopping at Big Sur and San Luis Obispo (or other stops) for a night or 2. We'll then continue to make our way to Los Angeles and stay there for 5 nights or so. We fly home from LAX.

Do you guys have suggestions on how I should handle/sort car rental? I'm not sure whether I need to rent in San Francisco or just start the rental in Carmel and take train or something down to Carmel because I don't think I need one while I'm in San Francisco..

Also any other highlights to hit up between Carmel and Los Angeles? We have availability to stay a night or two to really check things out in that beautiful stretch of California between those two cities..

b9tmze,travel,Booked a flight with Malindo but am now concerned about delays...any advice??,"Edit: I am well aware that most reviews that go online are negative ones and usually I wouldn't be so quick to get freaked out by a couple of bad reviews but (without being dramatic) almost all reviews I have come across mention delays and poor customer service-
https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Airline_Review-d8729203-Reviews-Malindo-Air
This link is a link to some of the reviews on trip advisor so eveyone can see what I mean 😊

First off, I feel so stupid for not checking out Malindo before booking my flights so if any comments regarding that could be kept to ones self that would be great!

 Anyway, for my 21st (this July) my friends and I have booked a contiki tour of Europe which starts in London. Now,being the broke uni student that I am,I hunted for the cheapest flights possible and (regrettably) was quiet naive about possible dodgy airlines. I found a great deal for my flights which includes a malindo airway flight from Perth to Kuala Lumpur and then onwards to Muscat and eventually London with Oman airways. 

I didn't think anything of it and was super happy with the deal I had gotten until I was chatting to my Dad about the upcoming trip and he mentioned that he had never heard of Malindo airways. This spurred me to look into them and almost every review I read talked about major delays and poor customer service. Since I have connecting flights and a contiki booked time is of the essence and I cannot afford delays and missed flights due to delays. 

I am 100% freaking out at the moment because the flights are non-refundable and I am screwed if my flight is delayed..(because I have to be on time for the contiki) I honestly don't know what to do so if anyone has flown with Malindo and can calm my nerves with positive stories that would be great or if anyone has advice or ways I can handle this situation that would be amazing..honestly, any advice would be great right now. 

Tldr: booked flights with Malindo but have since read some poor reviews and am feeling freaked out. ","Booked a flight with Malindo but am now concerned about delays...any advice??

b9tbbw,travel,Introspection & Soul searching destinations - Europe or South America for 1-2 months?,"Hi Folks,

As the title states, I've had some unpleasant time recently, and one of my recommendations has been that a trip will help to regain some connection to the inner self.

My work has been gracious to permit me a sabbatical (4-5 months) and I have had enough money + points saved to do an RtW ticket from Canada. My initial plan was to go from Canada to Europe, Asia, and then spend a few weeks visiting friends in Australia. One of the main reasons that Europe is appealing is due to a much better transportation infrastructure. 

However, I recently considered the idea of skipping Europe and travelling to South America instead. The reason partially for this is since I had a great time in Brasil on a solo trip in 2014, and lot of friends have recommended other SA countries.

Based on your experiences between SA and Europe, was there any place that pushed you out of your circle more and left you with a rewarding experience? Thank you!","Introspection & Soul searching destinations - Europe or South America for 1-2 months? Hi Folks,

b9snqs,travel,"Flying to London for two weeks in May with my boyfriend. I had a plan but I have doubts, since we've never been overseas. Help?","My boyfriend and I have always wanted to travel overseas, but until recently we didn't have the vacation time or the funds. We are 28/29 years old, from OH in the US.  Neither of us have been overseas, but we've both done a bit of US/Canada/Caribbean travel.  We will be there for 15 days including the days we arrive and depart, so 13 full days and 2 half days. I'm having a ton of anxiety about this trip, and my boyfriend is not at all a planner, so I'm feeling a little lost.

Budget:
About $6000, for the both of us combined

Interests:
We want to see multiple places since we have a whole two weeks, so we'd rather not stay in London the whole time.

We both like history, nature, architecture, and and general weird stuff. We'd like to get a good mix of city vs. nature on this trip. I want to make sure to see interesting things I've never seen before.

Really the only absolute musts we have now is to see Stonehenge and at least one Castle.

Our original plan was to take a eurorail and do a loop south to mainland but I'm worried that since I've never been and understand nothing of travel in that area I'm making a huge mistake trying to plan on my own. My boyfriend seems to want to just rent a car but I don't think the UK and Western Europe is super car/road trip friendly. 

Neither of us speak anything other than English.

I guess my main questions are how many places are even reasonable to see or get to in that amount of time? What's the most convenient way to city-hop and travel? And what are some great must-see destinations in areas we can hop to?  are there cool stuff outside of cities in places we can get to that's a bit off the beaten path?

anyway, if you all have any more questions feel free to ask! 

Edit: Thanks for all the advice. I guess I'm just nervous because it's so soon. I have anxiety so travel is occasionally difficult but rewarding nonetheless.

b9shul,travel,best resorts spots to go in may?,"hey all,

so me and my classmates graduated last year and been working in separate cities ever since, we were looking at things we could do and decided that a resort might be simplest and more budget friendly thing to do since it's very last minute. We are planning to do something in may, and most cruises are full already + since we live in canada we would have to pay more to get to the ship. and we kinda want something warm since we still have snow ha.

&#x200B;

last year i went in republic Dominican with my parents are a last family trip, we enjoyed it but we went in january and for me i felt it was very chilly and it rained half the time, it did have one good excursion where you would walk in a river trail. 

so one of my questions would be what country/region would be safest towards weather/food etc to have a nice warm time. ideally with lots of interesting excursions we are planning to do maybe 2 or 3 since after a day or 2 at the beach we would probably get board.  

budget is around 2k each for everything(including excursions) so probably can't go to like Madagascar, i assume that would be fairly expensive for the plain ticket to go there from candada.

&#x200B;

i was looking at domincan republic again since the prices where nice at like 1200 for a 5 start but is it good in may? and tbh only 1 or 2 decent excursions and wouldn't mind trying some place new,

Since I am spending so long in Southern Italy, I am figuring I should spend a good amount of time in Northern Italy, perhaps seeing Milan, Genoa, Bologna and Florence.

I haven't bought my ticket to Europe yet, so I have freedom for where I fly into. This trip is in late May, so I need to purchase quickly.

I'm hoping to get some insider advice from y'all. I have two three-week gaps coming up this summer and am planning to do one trip to Southeast Asia (likely Thailand and Vietnam) and one trip to Peru. The dates for travel are most of May and most of July.

My question is: does anyone have advice about which order to do the trips in? Peru in May and SE Asia in July, or the opposite?

My understanding is that the SE Asia rainy season starts in April, but I also saw May and June/July mentioned.  How rough is traveling to Thailand/Vietnam in the shoulder season vs. the height of the rainy season?

And I know it's drier in Peru during the winter, but it's also colder.  Was anyone uncomfortable during the deeper winter months?

I suppose another factor is avoiding crowds.  Maybe that should be more influential to my decision than the weather?

Any strong opinions out there?

b9knwq,travel,European Power Adapter Questions,"Hi!

I'm going to be traveling to Europe in 8 days. All appliances I'm bringing are dual voltage (110/220V). The only thing I'm confused about is if a type C adapter plug will work with type F and E outlets. 

From my research, in Europe, type C, E, and F outlets are used throughout the countries I'm going to. Would an adapter like this: https://www.amazon.com/Travel-Adapter-JOOMFEEN-Worldwide-Converters/dp/B01I9F3ONC work for the above outlet types?

Also, would that adapter work with a hair dryer and a hair straightener if they are both also dual voltage (110/220V)?

Here are the countries I'm going to in case anyone needs it:

Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary.","European Power Adapter Questions Hi!

b9gjg6,travel,First time flying/being in an airport and have a question.,"So I'm flying from Toronto (YYZ) to Japan (NRT) and have a 56 minute layover in Detroit (DTW), is this even enough time to make it off the 1st flight get my luggage and get onto the second?

I've never even been in an airport so I didn't think this could be an issue until my friend mentioned it.

Do I have to go through a second security checkpoint at all?

My Wife and I have traveled a lot in the last 6 years. We have been to Belize, England, Canada, The Dominican Republic, Ireland, Costa Rica and St Lucia. 

We have enjoyed places like Las Galeras in the Dominican Republic, San Pedro Belize, and Nuevo Arenal in Costa Rica. We enjoy off the beaten path places and I am working on being fluent in Spanish. (I'm generally scoring in the lower passing range of A1 fluency tests)

We would like to spend about 8 days traveling in a Spanish speaking country in Latin or south America in August 2019. When we looked up the weather for Ecuador we saw that it happens to be pretty cold around that time so we are debating on going to Panama. 

We thought about Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Honduras but, Panama seems to be safer per the state department. 

In all the countries that we have been to we enjoyed the rain forests as much as the beach and would enjoy doing something similar wherever we go. Are there semi off the beaten path places in Panama that sound like something we might enjoy? Would Honduras or Guatemala be possibly be better options for us? 

We are open to other countries that are Spanish speaking but, we would really like to visit somewhere that we have never been before. Any insight would be appreciated. 

We will be looking at a total budget of around $4000-$5000 with flights, food, hotels and a rental car. Thanks.","Experienced traveler looking for advice for Latin America in August 2019 Hello Travelers,

I'm currently trying to plan a Guatemala/Belize trip from **Nov 9 - Nov 18th** with a few friends all male. We all speak spanish/english.

I'm not sure on how to distribute our limited days but regarding direction/order of travel I was planning something along the lines of flying into Guatemala City and head over to Antigua (Climb Pacaya Volcano).

Later on visit Lake Atitlan, probably stay in San Pedro (not sure what the best activities beyond visiting other villages)

After that is where things start to get fuzzy, not sure if we should aim to go towards Semuc Champey/Flores/Rio Dulce or instead move over to Belize (Belize City/Ambergris Caye/Caye Caulker). I'd really appreciate any itinerary or advice.

We're not aiming to have a lot of ""downtime"" as we don't have many vacations days so we don't mind having a packed schedule but also I want to make sure we're not biting more than we can chew. Since it's 6 of us I'm leaning towards more of a party-vibe and shying away from couple destinations.

Budget p/person is 2000USD without flights (we're based in Argentina), we're all in our mid 20's and have no Visa requirements for either country.

b9iheu,travel,Itinerary for 8 day Swiss Travel Pass?,"Hi guys,

My girlfriend and I are planning to enjoy Switzerland this year. Our current plan is 4 days but I am thinking 8 days is better. Simply because Swiss Travel Pass is cheaper on a daily basis if the one purchased is the 8 days and sometimes you get discounts in hotel, etc. if you stay longer (we are thinking Bern and Lucerne as the bases). 

I am aware Schilthorn, Rigi and Stanserhorn are free again (yay) this year.

The current destinations (minimum) are as follows:

Bern (1st base) - 1 day 
Zermatt - 1 day
Schilthorn, Murren, Wengen - 1 day
Lucerne (2nd base) - 1 day
Rigi - 1 day
Lugano, Bellinoza - 1 day

We still have two days to fill. Our only limitation is we really try to stick to bases rather than keep moving accommodations to make full use of the Pass and avail of cheaper accomodations.

Hope you can suggest places to fill in those two days!","Itinerary for 8 day Swiss Travel Pass? Hi guys,

b9f7vl,travel,What to do when your boyfriend doesn’t want to travel?,"How do you choose to leave behind someone you love for a career and a life that will make you happy, or choose someone you love over experiences you’ve always dreamed for yourself? 


My boyfriend and I have been together a few years and we do live together however, prior to moving in, prior to officially dating, I told him I want to travel and that I want to continue working abroad within my life and just live. I let him know about 6/7 months before moving in that I really want to take time to explore the world and travel after I’m done school and I’d like him to come with me to which he told me he’d think about. I gave him some time to think, and let him know that if it’s something he didn’t want to do, maybe living together wouldn’t be the best idea and he told me multiple times he wants to travel with me which I thought was great (we had multiple talks about traveling, I asked him to be honest as well because I still have to respect his decision).,, so fast forward to living together and signing a contract, he let me know that he doesn’t want to travel or work abroad after moving in, and then when I spoke to him yesterday, and told him I felt like he lied to me because he was secretly hoping that I’d just get comfortable and change my mind, he admitted to me that’s why he lied. 

Like is this selfish of me wanting to move away? Is it selfish of me to leave because I know what I want with my life and maybe he needs some time to think and be comfortable? I just feel guilty to be honest, but the feeling of exploring and having all of these memories being made just excites me and it’s something that hasn’t gone away since my last big trip years ago.

I just wanted to add that I’ve made multiple attempts to even do short trip with him that don’t normally end up working out unfortunately when it’s time to plan , as ell as he will talk about small trips but he also makes conversations short about it it (like I’ve been asking to go to Quebec for a weekend one week for like a year and it just hasn’t seemed to happen yet) .","What to do when your boyfriend doesn’t want to travel?

I’ve got 10 days and would like to hit the usual highlights and then spend a few days relaxing on a beach somewhere. I’ve never been to Greece, so I’m open to input and suggestions to make the best use of my time given the holiday. 

Thanks!"

b9e1gi,travel,"Day 1 Itinerary Help - LV to Zion drive - Hoover and Valley of Fire, or straight to Zion?","Overall trip is Zion, Powell/Antelope Canyon, Grand Canyon, and Sedona in last half of September. Day one we land in Vegas in the morning and hope to pull out of rental place by 10:30 a.m. We want to do a short, quick, end-of-day hike in Zion to get acclimated to the shuttles (thinking Lower Emerald Pools) before hitting Angel's Landing and the Narrows on Day 2.

Is stuff between LV and Zion worth seeing, or should we beeline to Zion? Specifically, the plan is Hoover Dam, back through the Lake Mead Rec Area (167, have Annual Pass), to Valley of Fire Highway (cash toll). We'd take that west until it connects with I-15, then head NE to Red Cliff/St. George and ultimately to Springdale. (If there's anything else between I-15 and Springdale happy to hear it, but  haven't researched it deeply.) We'd be staying in the car except for overlooks or < 0.5 mile loops. 

Or, skip all that and beeline for Zion - court of the patriarchs or weeping rock, etc.

Edit: Plus losing an hour due to time zones.

I love travelling and I am quite happy with my life and decisions. That being said, I am just wondering off late, that I have quite drifted out of all my friends circle from college and high school. No fights, no arguments just sort went separate ways.

For consideration. I am a 34 year old guy. I work as a first mate in commercial ships. For stretches of 3-4 months I sail across Atlantic, Pacific, China Coast etc for work. Then I get vacations of 3-4 months. In those months I am free. Like sleep-and-don't-know-what-date-is-it free. So, when I sign off from ships, I immediately go visit my parents for a day because of my mum's food. Also because I don't own a car or a house. Then I bounce out to wherever I feel like for 3-4 months until I am called to join the ship again. Rinse, repeat for last 10 years.

Now, because of this lifestyle I seem to have lost quite a lot friends actually. My friends who work on land are either married with children. Or they travel with me for a week or two and then leave. Because they only get that many days off. And my friends who sail like me from college have started to settle down and become lazy for lack of a better word.

I partially blame this occurrence on my career choice. But also a little bit on my excessive travelling.
Again, I am not feeling lonely or sad about it. I have been having quite a lot of fun. Met quite a lot of young, interesting and new people along the way.
But I am feeling a little scared to be honest. It's dawning upon me that I don't have any good friends anymore.

We are going in early July. So far the plan is to fly into San Fran and grab a car at the airport (we already booked the cheapest version, it's a convertible to get some sun on our pasty Canadian winter faces). From there we need to head over to Sacramento for a concert the same night. Starting the following day we are free though and would love help on where to stay, where to eat and what to visit.

We will be traveling on the Pacific Coast highway and will have 8 days to get from Sacramento to San Diego and then the last day is reserved to shoot back up to San Francisco for our flight/car return (inconvenient but so much cheeper for the car rental).

&#x200B;

Some questions/suggestion requests:

\- How much should we budget for gas for 8 days approximately (not familiar with gas prices in US).

\- Would love for some beach suggestions to stop on the way for surfing and just hanging out.

\- Do you have any suggestions for some cities to visit?

\- Any safety concerns with parking? Areas we should avoid?

\- Any specific places or cool things that we can do on the way?

\- Will we be passing wine country? Where would be the best place to stop for that?

As for Vienna to Salzburg, is it worth it to book in advance? Should I use the Westbahn train the day of and pay the conductor? I researched and I am mainly finding that there is not a worry about price difference, infact there is not one. What do you guys suggest?"

b906ap,travel,Solo travelling across Europe from mid-April to mid-June - looking for input and recommendations!,"Hi All,

I will be travelling across Europe for about two months this spring. I will be starting in Amsterdam for a few days around April 17, and then headed east to Turkey before making my way back west. I am visiting a handful of destinations where I have friends, as well as a handful on my own. My loose itinerary (not booked, just planned as a rough route) is as follows:

1. Amsterdam [arrive April 17]
2. Prague
3. Budapest
4. Turkey (Istanbul > Cappadocia > Aegan Sea)
5. Croatia (Dubrovnik > drive through Bosnia & Herzegovina > up to Pula > boat to Venice)
6. Italy (Venice > Milan > maybe Pisa or Bologna??)
7. Berlin
8. London
9. Caen (for the Anniversary of D-Day landings)
10. Barcelona
11. Porto
12. Lisbon [leave June 19]

My interests are primarily around exploring cities and towns, and getting a good idea of the history behind each place. I love meeting locals and spending time off the tourist track. I am also very interested in food and drink (coffee and beer), and love going on treks, hikes, and outdoor adventures. I have less interest in pursuing general tourist spots (with the exceptions of obvious must-see's). I am expecting to spend between $1.5k - $2.5k per month, with the higher amount being in the western portion of Europe.

My research has put me so far to about 5 days per destination, with a little less time in Berlin, London, and Caen, and a bit more time in Turkey & Croatia. I think that's more or less doable. In theory I can cut out parts of Turkey, Croatia, Barcelona, or Portugal if it makes sense.

I would love to get any input on places to visit and/or things to do that more-or-less line up with my loose plans above. I'm also happy to include any detours that would be worth while. I am keen to travel by air, rail, car, or bike. Looking to explore cities, regions, towns, and more.

b948w1,travel,Is Koningsdag / King’s Day in Amsterdam worth planning a trip around?,"Greetings everyone - long time reader, first time poster.

I have found some insight online, but would prefer advice with my specific set of circumstances/context.

My base question is:  Is planning a trip around Koningday / King Day worth it just for one day (although I plan to stay a week)?

Background/Context:

I am traveling alone, flying in and out of Paris, and taking the train to Amsterdam and somewhere in the south of France (as yet undetermined) over a couple of weeks at the end of April.

After doing research and speaking with friends, I chose Amsterdam above all other major city destinations in Western Europe to hit as a secondary trip from Paris.  The main reasons for that were (1) quality of the museums, (2) reading a lot about the small/comfortable feel of the atmosphere, (3) hearing about the friendliness of the people, and (4) the historical significance of Amsterdam as a center of world commerce and influence.  There are probably some other reasons, but those are the main ones.  I guess I am also implying that while I do like to drink and have a good time, I don’t have any interest in the “pharmaceutical” part of Amsterdam or the Red Light District’s “services”.  (For what it’s worth I am male, single, and straight, and I think I’m generally pretty friendly and tend to meet people when I am traveling alone.)

Anyway - as I am finalizing my itinerary and schedule, I am realizing that it works a lot better if I don’t feel like I have to be in Amsterdam for King Day.  Basically the tradeoff is that I really want a good unbroken stretch of days in Paris at the end of my trip, and to get that I would have to move my Amsterdam visit earlier and miss King Day.

I have looked online and asked the question of the hotel staff, but it’s a very difficult question to answer.  And I also know that I am asking Reddit a question that begs a highly subjective answer.

So - is King Day worth it?  Or am I going to walk around all day, get to the end of it and think “that was fun, but not worth planning a trip around.”

(If anybody has been to Fiesta in San Antonio, Texas - where I live - please feel free to compare and contrast)

​

A few disclaimers:

* Our flights and accommodation has already been booked. We'll be staying in Sorrento. We're fairly close to the train station (.5km) for reference.
* We are in our mid 20s that would prefer more walking and exploring rather than laze around in beaches and relax. We're more into scenery and photos/drone footages
* Not really interested in beaches
* We don't drink or live for the nightlife.
    
**Day 1:** Arrive into Rome (FCO) and travel down to Sorrento via rail to Naples and then ferry into Sorrento. Go up a bunch of stairs and check in to our place around 6:30 P.M. Enjoy the streets of Sorrento and have dinner.

**Day 2:** Positano. Not sure of anything specific I should do here aside from walking around and enjoying the views. I was thinking of renting one of those boats.

**Day 3:** Capri Day Trip via ferry. Was thinking of visiting Garden at Villa San Michele, Gardens of Augustus, Krupp zigzag road, blue grotto, and Monte Salerno. Not sure how much of it is feasible. Alternatively, I was thinking of renting a boat here and circling around the island that way.

**Day 4:** Pompeii day trip via train. Made a note to bring water, sunscreen, and purchase tickets. I googled around to purchase online but some of the sites seemed a bit dodgy. Is there a more official site to purchase tickets?

**Day 5:** Day trip to Amalfi town/Ravello. Was thinking of doing the Path of Gods on this day and rent a boat if I don't do so in Day 2.

**Day 6:** Flight back home is at 6:30 P.M from Rome, I was wondering if I can fit in anything during the morning/noon in the coast somewhere. 

Couple questions I have:

* Is there anything I can do ahead of time before my flight? Book rail/ferry tickets, make reservations, etc?
* Will I need to carry cash? I prefer living through my cards but not sure if it's feasible in the Amalfi Coast.
* I plan to grab a 3 (Tre ITA) sim card at the airport. Anyone have any success with it?

Also, other than restaurants, are there any services (taxis, bellhops, tour guides, etc) that I should tipping.

b91du9,travel,Tips for students traveling in Australia,"Hi!

My girlfriend and I are planning on going to Australia in June-July or July-August (this is when we have our summer holidays so it's not possible to travel any other time of the year). We are thinking around 4-6 weeks. We are students so we try to keep the costs low.

We would like to do a road trip down the East coast from Cairns to Sydney in one of those small camper vans (e.g. Jucy, Spaceships). But since it is winter time in Australia, would it be too cold to sleep in a camper van? I'm thinking that the more south you go, the colder it gets and then we might not be able to sleep in it? We are from Sweden so the weather overall during winter time does not seem so bad for us. We are just worried about the nights.

We are interested in visiting Uluru and see some of the outback but I'm wondering if driving there would be any fun or if it's better to fly there? We are both not big fans of driving for long periods without stopping to see something. Also, which itinerary would be best if we want to do both the East coast and Uluru?

Any help, tips, and feedback are much appreciated! Thank you 🙂","Tips for students traveling in Australia Hi!

b90fwb,travel,14 Day Euro Trip for Two Amateurs,"My wife and I have just started planning a 14 day trip to Europe for sometime in the fall/winter of 2020.  We’re trying to narrow down the countries we would like to visit.  We both have never been outside of the USA.  We’re looking for some general input on whether our high-level plans sound OK or not.  We don’t really have a specific budget, but we’re not trying to go overboard either.  

* Iceland (2-3 days) – Primary reason is to see the northern lights as it’s something we’ve both always wanted to do.  Reykjavík is our most likely destination solely based on not knowing much about Iceland, and it looks like it takes a decent amount of travel time to get from Reykjavík to other major destinations in Iceland (Akureyri, Landmannalaugar Park, Lake Myvatn, Vatnajökull National Park).  Looking for suggestions on if 2-3 days is enough time and what we should focus on seeing.

* Netherlands (2-4 days) – I’ve heard excellent things about the Netherlands and would love to visit Amsterdam in particular.  There are a handful of museums we would like to visit (National Museum, Resistance Museum, Van Gogh) and a few areas (Vondelpark, Leidseplein, Nine Little Streets).

* Germany (3-4 days) – Germany has been at the top of my list of trips forever.  I’ve learned a decent amount of the language and culture throughout my school career.  Berlin would be our primary destination and it seems like there’s plenty to keep us occupied in the city (museums, historical sites).  We’re open to visiting another city like Cologne, Hamburg, Munich, etc. if time permits, but I’m not planning on it.

* Croatia/Austria/Czech Republic/Hungary/Greece (2-4 days) – Here’s where we have a decision to make.  We’d like to visit one more country for a total of 4, but we’re undecided on which one.  My wife is leaning toward Croatia, and I would like to visit Hungary.  Is 14 days enough time to travel to 4 countries, or should we limit ourselves to 3?  If we did visit a fourth, which would you recommend?  

I would love to hear your input as we’re completely new to international travel.  Any tips or recommendations are greatly appreciated!  Once we narrow down our countries, we can get to work on the specifics.

b94el2,travel,Advice for Travelling Europe,"So I am a soon to be 21 y/o and I'm thinking about visiting Europe from Canada at the end of August (after Aug 16). I will probably be going alone

1. I'm not sure what the best way of travelling Europe is? I'm thinking of booking a short, one-week tour and just follow along so I don't have to do my own planning. However, I'm not sure if those are any good in terms of price, quality, reliability and everything else. Is it better if I do my own planning?
2. Also, I just wanna quickly see as many major destinations in as little time as possible (Eiffel tower, Stonehenge, Colosseum, Louvre, you get the point). I don't wanna spend multiple days exploring one country in depth. Would going alone or just booking a tour be easier if this is my plan? Perhaps booking individual tours in each country?
3. What are the prices for the different countries? Which tend to be more expensive than others? I would also prefer to go to countries where some people at least have a general understanding of English.
4. Obviously the I want to spend as little as possible but I don't need to be staying in hostels or anything. Would Airbnb be a good idea for living or are there better options? In terms of transport, if I don't book a tour then I guess I'll have to go with Uber or just taxis unless I can figure out the public transport system in a country with some English speakers?
5. Lastly, when should I book everything (flights, accommodations, tours)? When are they the cheapest if I plan to go late August.

If there's anything I missed that's very important to know for going to Europe, let me know! I'm interested in hearing your responses.

If there's anything I missed that's very important to know for going to Europe, let me know! I'm interested in hearing your responses.

We plan to be in Australia for November and from here do a bit of traveling and working.

Can anyone give me some insight into how this works?

Do we just fly into Aus with our pre approved visa and travel like normal then when we want money just start applying for jobs?

Do we need to set up an Australian bank account?

Do most travelers who do this work while still living in a hostel?

I'm quite confused about the whole experience so if you have done something similar please get in touch!

b8vo5x,travel,Is 1 week in the US worth it?,"Hey!

I'm from the UK. The last time I went to the US was 2012 for 3 weeks when I was in University and went over there to stay with some friends.

Fast-forward to now, I have a friend that lives in Nashville. He's getting married and moving to Orlando in 2020 and I don't really have anything in Orlando I want to see.

My girlfriend is a school teacher, and as such, her PTO is strictly limited to when school is out. At the moment, we're looking at her half term in October, flying out on the Saturday arriving in BNA for around 6pm and then flying back on the Sunday at 6am so we arrive in LHR for 10:30pm and straight into work the next day. We've both done things like this re: our sleeping patterns before so I think we could hack it fine.

Anyway, the other option is visiting in August, but the flights are so much more expensive. We can get a return to Nashville in October for a week for £725 between us, but in August that's roughly the cost EACH. Then, obviously if we went in August we'd go specifically to stay longer, so we'd end up spending more money on hotels or an AirBnB.

I said to my girlfriend would it not make sense to go for a week in October and then save that money we would have spent just to go in August on another trip out to NYC in March/April 2020 for a week or so? Or would you guys say it's worth the extra £6-700 for 3 or 4 more nights out there in Nashville?


I know ""worth it"" is entirely subjective but so many people have said ""oh, only a week? why?"" when I mentioned the idea to them that I'm second guessing myself.","Is 1 week in the US worth it? Hey!

I have been in Australia for the last 6 months, and I’m on the fence about when I should go home — I decided around last month that I wasn’t going to go for the second year working holiday visa, and that I’ll plan to come home in September (when my visa expires.) A couple things triggered that decision — it took me a little while to get past people saying “you’d be mad to not go for your second year visa”, and for a while I did think just that. But I really thought about it and I knew I’d be content with one year away. 


Anyways, I’ve been living in Sydney, and I’ve now got a job as an Au Pair out in Perth. I’ve been super keen to go out to Perth, and this seemed like a good way to do it! But now, I’m kind of second guessing my decision to work as an Au Pair. 


I also do miss my job, as corny as it sounds it took some time away for me to realize how much I did love my job — despite complaining a lot lol. 


I also think I’ve gotten everything out of travel I wanted, I have a much clearer mind than when I started. I’ve also enjoyed “finding myself”...if you will — and for that, I feel ready to go home.

A few friends and myself want to travel to Indonesia during the summer and I just have a few questions if people can answer. By the way, we are only travelling for two weeks, 14 full days:

1. I decided on Yogyakarta to Bali. We will travel between these two places and explore everything in between. As weird as it sounds, is this enough to get the 'Indonesia' experience? As much as I would love to do the whole of the main islands of Indonesia, I feel 2 weeks is not enough time. So I had to pick somewhere that would be an adventure, someplace I could get involved and see the culture, as well as having fun with friends (like drinks, scenery, etc.). But am I doing the right thing? Is this enough? Or am I leaving out a huge chunk of opportunity here. I am really unsure about if the journey I have picked is sufficient enough for these aims.

2. What is the process for getting scooters to travel around? I know you can collect a licence at a local police station, but how does that work? Or is it even worth getting a local license? And how often to police pull tourists over?

3. While I will be seeing all the tourist sites and whatnot, I always enjoyed going off the beaten track and seeing the locals areas or other amazing sites. Any recommendations?

4. What are hostels like here?

5. I was in Vietnam before. Are the cultures and lifestyles different? Or will I be seeing the same thing?

And that is it! If anyone can help me organise, thank you very much!

My question - if airlines sold out do they add more frequent flights? Prices has been fluctuating going up and down, is that due to supply? 
Last year I think I waited too long and ended up overpaying for my flight to Japan. I'm on a way tighter budget for travel this year so want to get a good deal and keep my flight cost as low as possible. Any advice is welcomed!

I'm trying to decide if I should book now or continue to wait. A couple weeks ago there was flights from Canada to Beijing at ~$650 range and was extremely cheap. I saw this deal at work but once I got home the deal was gone... Now I'm contemplating if I should continue to wait or just book. 

My question - if airlines sold out do they add more frequent flights? Prices has been fluctuating going up and down, is that due to supply? 
Last year I think I waited too long and ended up overpaying for my flight to Japan. I'm on a way tighter budget for travel this year so want to get a good deal and keep my flight cost as low as possible. Any advice is welcomed! 

Thanks in advance!"

They screwed up my connecting flight in Bogota to Cali (lost my reservation) which caused a significant delay and for me to have to rebook that segment. I got my new ticket, checked my bag, went through immigration and then on to my gate with an hour to spare. 

I was in the middle of dinner with clients at Outback when the police came and got me.  They told me to bring my things and come with them.  I go. We go into the interior of the airport where there is a room with 6-8 cops.  They ask for my passport, and point to a bag and ask me if it’s mine. It is not mine.  I say no. Then they talk, look through some paper work, compare my passport info to the luggage tag and one of them takes me on a walk to a different room with 4-5 cops in it. This time it’s MY bag.  They ask if it’s mine and I say yes. 

Then they open my bag and search it thoroughly.  Nothing in there of course.  So they zip it up and then I’m asked to follow them again back to the original room they brought me to.

**Itinerary**

**Day 1, 2, 3: Edinburgh (3 nights)**

* Arrive after 4pm the first day, staying in the city center
* Planning to see: Edinburgh Castle, National Museum of Scotland, hike Arthur's Seat, Calton Hill 
* Any suggestions on doing a night ghost tour, the Camera Obscura museum, or other things around the city?

**Day 4: Aviemore (1 night)**

* Late start in order to pick up rental car, then planning to stop in Perth for lunch
* Planning to see: Cairngorms National Park, Carrbridge, Reindeer Park the following morning

**Day 5 & 6: Inverness (2 nights)**

* Mostly using as a base camp, but staying on the outskirts of the city
* Planning to see: Culloden battlefield, drive south to Loch Ness, and drive north to Dunrobin Castle 

**Day 7, 8, 9, 10: Isle of Skye (4 nights)**

* Planning to stop at Eilean Donan Castle, and Portree; staying in Uig
* Planning to see: Old Man of Storr, Fairy Pools, Neist Point Lighthouse, Quirang, dinosaur foot tracks near Staffin
* Suggestions needed on potential day trips to other isles, or other good hiking trails on Skye.

**Day 11 & 12: Fort William (2 nights)**

* Potentially taking the ferry to Mallaig, driving past Glennfinnan and see the Jacobite train
* Originally we were planning on riding the Jacobite train but it is sold out, is it worth trying to get tickets, or skip and just do a similar drive along the tracks?
* Planning to hike Ben Nevis

**Day 13: Loch Lomond (1 night)**

* Drive through Glenco, potential side trip to re-create that scene from Skyfall
* Opinions on hiking within Loch Lomond, any nearby castles worth seeing, or the Devil's Pulpit?

**Day 14: Glasgow (1 night)**

* We will be staying near the airport, but will spend the entire day in Glasgow
* Planning to see: the Kelpies, Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum
* Suggestions: this is my least researched city, so any suggestions would be appreciated!

I know this is normally a place to share photos and talk destinations. So I’m not sure if this fits, but I am kind of stuck and hoping to get some advice from some of you well seasoned travelers. 


So yesterday I flew from Istanbul to Los Angeles, I arrived in Los Angeles with no bag. I filed a claim and spoke with the representative and they have zero information on the bag. No scans or anything. I have the receipt from the checked bag, so I have proof it was checked in Istanbul, but it appears it never made it out of instanbul. 

It’s currently been over 24 hours with zero info on the bag, not even a confirmation that it is in fact still in instanbul. So as of now, my bag doesn’t exist at all. 


Normally I wouldn’t be so stressed about this as it’s just a bag. But it actually had a few things in there that I need for a job tomorrow, I was hoping to get the bag back by now but it looks like that is not happening any time soon. 


Here is a run down of what’s in the bag. 


1. Bag itself is a $450 think tank rolling camera bag. 


2. Tripod - $375

3. Light stand - $130

4. Work clothes -$250 (medium level designer stuff) 

5. Bunch of other cheaper clothes and stuff. 


The main problem is I need the bag itself (it’s my camera bag for work), the tripod, lightstand and my clothes( My work is high end real estate photography, so I have clothes specifically for that job/scmoozing with rich people) 

I called United and explained to them the situation and they said they will cover rentals only. I might, MIGHT be able to rent the tripod/light stand but honestly I live pretty far away from any rental houses. 

Most likely I will need to drive an hour out of town and purchase everything I’ll need for around $1,300 dollars. I’m NOT psyched about this one bit, but if it comes down to it. I’ll need to make this happen. 


My question is, how do I go about fixing this situation? I need to find a solution in the next few hours and I’m terrified of going out and blowing $1300 only to be told they won’t cover anything.

&#x200B;

So before everything, I know that redditors are not qualified to answer questions about ESTA applications, but I'm hoping I'll get at least a few pointers as to what to do. 

I'm a French citizen and have applied yesterday for an ESTA - it was approved. However, the French application is very confusing regarding to names telling me that I should include ""all of my first names as they appear in the passport"". I'm confused as to what ""all of my first names"" could mean, since, by definition, I only have one. As a result, I only put the first of my three given names. 

However, I'm second-guessing myself and wondering if I should re-apply and put all of my first names. I called the ESTA management office. The lady who answered seemed very much out of it but did tell me I needed all of my names needed to be there. When I asked her if it might look suspicious to apply for a second ESTA within 24 hours, she was just like ""Oh well, maybe, I can't tell you"". Also, I didn't get any conclusive answer as to how I should type my names. In my passport, they look like this ""First,Second,Third"", with a comma and no space separating each, but I worry the comma will count as a special character. 

What do you guys think? If anyone here has applied to ESTA this year and has several given names, how did you fill the application? Do you think I might look suspicious too renew an ESTA so quickly?

&#x200B;

Sorry for the kind of incoherent message. I'm freaking out a bit, since the idea of being sent back by immigration officers is quite unpleasant, and I'm very afraid of making a small mistake.

So before everything, I know that redditors are not qualified to answer questions about ESTA applications, but I'm hoping I'll get at least a few pointers as to what to do. 

I'm a French citizen and have applied yesterday for an ESTA - it was approved. However, the French application is very confusing regarding to names telling me that I should include ""all of my first names as they appear in the passport"".

b8mnos,travel,Help deciding on Greek Islands?!,"Hi r/Travel 

My fiance and I are traveling to Greece at the end of Aug/early Sept (Aug 29-Sept 3) as we have a wedding in Tuscany Sept 7 and we want to travel a bit beforehand. We've been to Greece 4 years ago and did Santorini, Mykonos, and Milos.  

&#x200B;

We'd like to visit a new Greek island, but I'm having trouble deciding on where to go! 

&#x200B;

Some criteria: 

* We are not partiers as we come from NYC and want this to be more of a beach vacation and sitting at beach bars during the day and eating dinner by the water vs. being out until the wee hours of the night. 
* We are open to having to travel to an island, but prefer something with direct flights from Athens. 
* We absolutely loved all of the previous islands, but something that stood out about Milos and Mykonos is the tons of tavernas and restaurants that are littered next to bays and the ocean. We loved being able to stroll through the white washed towns and sneak into tavernas for some wine and drinks after dinner. 
* We'd also love to stay at a nice hotel with beach access, but am open to a nice Airbnb. 

A few islands that I'm looking at: 

* Kefalonia
   * Pro: Beautiful beaches and direct flight to Rome 
   * Con: From what I've read, it's a bit sleepy. Also a very large island and also read that the main towns are not as enchanting given the sheer size of the island. 
* Crete
   * Pro: Beautiful beaches, lots to do 
   * Con: Given the size of the island, there will be a lot of tourists and everything will be quite spread out so we'd likely be spending a considerable amount of time driving around to locations
* Paros/Antiparos
   * Pros: Typical Greek whitewashed islands, we loved that charm to Milos and the other islands 
   * Con: From my understanding, Paros is a big party island 

I know I'm likely being picky and all of the islands will have their pros/cons but would love to hear from the community on their experience at islands outside Santorini and Mykonos and Milos and hear of any recommendations I may be missing!

As a rough guideline, my hobbies include music, sport, nature and photography/videography (just like any typical 25 year old). I'm not on a very tight budget and I am willing to splurge a bit for experiences.

Currently **my Itinerary** looks something like this:

* 4th May - 15th May (currently have not planned anything - was hoping to travel down either the West Coast / East Coast and catch a few NBA playoffs games)
* 16th May - 23rd May (Las Vegas for EDC week)
* 24th May - 25th May (Tour to Grand Canyon)
* 26th May - 31st May (nothing planned - however I have heard amazing things regarding camping at Yosemite and was considering fitting something here on that)
* 1st June (arrive in Calgary, Canada)
* 1st June - 14th June (have a 14 day Canadian Rockies camping trip planned here, with the tour ending at Vancouver)

We're traveling by flixbus most of the time because it's the cheapest but as distances grow, we realize we need to use planes too. We've reached a very comfortable point up until Vienna but after that, the whole thing crumbles down. 

Trip is from May 18th to June 10th, starts and ends in Frankfurt, but we also must be at Prague on June 3rd or 4th to meet someone.

The idea was to go to Naples, but apparently there's no cheap flight from Vienna to Naples, so we switched with Rome... But then, there's no cheap flight from Rome to anywhere! So we were trying to catch a bus from Rome to Naples and fly from Naples to Budapest (because it gets us close to Prague and it looks very nice) but it's a stupid idea because we'd only have like 2 hours to be in Naples before the flight, so the bus ticket feels wasted. I realize we might have to rescind Italy... But I still don't know where to go after Vienna? If you have some recommendation that would be great... We'd really love to see more of Eastern Europe and we also wanted to visit an Italian beach but we didn't know any viable options.

So far, we found spots in Cracow (Poland) and in Split (Croatia). While those are some awesome places, maybe some of you know of other amazing spots that are lesser known and worth a visit.

Our budget is limited. Five star places are out of the question. It may cost more than a backpackers place but should be around 2000 Euros for the whole 4 days.

I am an American passport-holder. I spent my allotted 90 days in the Schengen zone, then came to Morocco (non-Schengen).

Plan B: Fly Morocco to Barcelona, have a 3-hour layover in Barcelona, fly home. (Less risky as I wouldn’t leave the airport)

If I show that I have bought the flight home would that be enough evidence to prove that I do not intend to emigrate illegally? Would it be ok that the 2 flights (Morocco to Barcelona, Barcelona to U.S.) are bought separately? Or would I be likely to get fined/punished regardless?

b8902x,travel,Planning a trip to Italy? AMA,"Ok, I'm bored. And probably many of you are thinking about a trip to Italy.
So if you have any question, I'll be more than happy to help: because I love my country and I like people that love it.

Just some points:

* I've been in a lot of places, but not everywhere in Italy. I'm from nearby Milan and my family is from Puglia. So I'm more specialized in the north of Italy and in a good part of the south. 
* I've been to Rome, Venice, Florence and the main cities many times.
* I've travelled many times abroad too, if you wonder 
* I'm not really into sports, so I can't probably help if you have questions about canoeing in Valle d'Aosta for example :P
* I can look and translate stuff for you on the Internet if you need it, but don't ask me to book anything for you. :)

b8ghbz,travel,Packaging problems,"Hi, I started to travel frequently in the past few months and I would like to continue but I would like to get some tips or tricks how I can package my things.
Last time I was travelling to Tromso from Madrid and I tried to bring as less as possible for my trip. I put some clothes into my luggage but half of the space was needed for my jacket so I decided to remove the big jacket and add a smaller less warmer jacket. When I arrived to Tromso it was to cold and couldn't stay outside in that jacket what I brought with me. In the end I needed to buy a warm jacket, what I actually didn't need it. 
After I came back to Madrid I sold my old jacket. 

Did similar thing happened with you before?

b89p8j,travel,Balkan Itinerary Critique (Help Much Appreciated),"Method of Travel: Mostly rental cars, but border logistics may dictate some change up in that?Time: Late August 29th to September 15th (\~17 days including inbound/outbound, \~15 days in area)

Initial thoughts/points:

1. I think that adding another hotel anywhere else including Dubrovnik will create a rushed feeling because of the logistics of packing/checking in/etc. (maybe that is less than issue with rental car, last few trips have been no rental) therefore any additions may require a subtraction(?).
2. Good chance I'll get 4th night free (Credit Card) in Kotor and Saranda (or Ksamil), but I can forfeit that in either town if the trip needs it.
3. Athens was about getting an efficient flight out after Meteora not really to visit it.
4. I tend to appreciate adventure activities and find a little more charm in the grittiness of the developing world.
5. I tend to avoid very large crowds and places that feel like tourist traps, but I can accept and even appreciate them in small doses.
6. If there is any spot that I feel like I'm shortchanging its Tirana as unique capital of the centerpiece of my trip, but I don't know if I want to take a day away from south to give it to Tirana.

***Initial questions:***

1. ***How do you think my pace is?***
2. ***Any messes I'm creating for myself,***
3. ***Is there something very special I'm missing and how would I fit it in?***
4. ***Do you think the 5 4+ hour longer drives are going to get to me (I don't think so, but maybe I'm being naive).***
5. ***Is the coastal route to Saranda actually worth the extra time vs the faster inland road.***

b8errk,travel,What is the perfect spot for Mom/Daughter (teen) Duo for R&R/Fun/History between Munich & Paris in early July? We have 5 nights free after a 10 day (busy) tour through Austria.,"I am looking for advice for a trip this summer with my 16 year-old daughter. She is performing on a 10-day dance tour through Austria (I will accompany her). We have five days at the end to spend together. 

We are starting in Budapest in late June, going on a 10-day tour including Vienna, Salzberg, Innsbruck, day trip to Venice. We end in Munich July 5th.  My daughter will be rehearsing/performing most of those days. I will be sightseeing/hiking.

We have arranged tours to see castles, go hand gliding and other sightseeing/shopping excursions on this part of our trip, so I'd like something different for our last six days/five nights. We fly back to the US from Paris, so we were planning on spending a couple of nights there, but don't have to, as our flight is late in the afternoon.

I want to go to Dachau while in the Munich area. Beyond that, I'm not sure where to go.  We are on a pretty tight budget for this last leg of our journey! Neither of us are into overly touristy or busy scenes. 

I love mountains, hiking, water sports, performing arts, cuisine, architecture, history. She loves laying on the beach, boating, adventure, cuisine and history (somewhat - she is studying WWII now).  I would like to see everything possible! She will be pretty worn out after her dance tour and I don't think she'd be very pleasant to drag around too many places afterwards.

Is there a spot between Munich and Paris where both of us could get what we want for 3-4 nights? A beautiful, interesting place to base ourselves with an easy excursion or two nearby? Also good food, relaxed vibe, safe? And budget-friendly?

I've studied Croatia, Italy, Spain, Amsterdam, London. I've just started to consider Switzerland/Lake Thun area. I'm stymied!

I appreciate any advice you'd care to share!

Thanks!

If so we could 1)After Florence, drive through Bologna, Modena, Verona, then on to Venice for two nights. OR  2) we could go up to Cinque Terre from Florence, then to Venice (pit stop in Bologna). Option 3: stick to our plan of going to the Dolomites, and just have 1.5 days in Venice.

We've never done this before, but we heard it's one of the best ways to travel Ireland. I guess my questions would be:

\-Is parking a hard thing to come by in Ireland? 

\-Is a car something we need to book ahead of time or when we arrive at the airport?

A decision had not been made, but I was given the option to leave, as it was very nearly a rejection, and this way it's more likely to be accepted. 

Since I was required to leave, I asked if it was okay to leave Sweden and then come back on a tourist visa, which I was told yes it's fine. 
So with a statement ""I (name) Am officially leaving Sweden and therefore forfeitting my right to work and reside here"" I flew out of Sweden, to Germany. 
I gave my letter to passport officials, who then stamped it and took it. 

Here's the problem, they didn't stamp my passport, reason being I was flying to Germany, so there was no passport control when I was actually leaving the Schengen zone, which is why they stamped the letter  instead. 
When I arrived in Germany, they flicked through my passport and said ""you've overstayed your visa in Sweden, which means you were illegally there"" and I was like no no no no you don't understand...
They let me through, but didn't stamp my passport. 
So now, neither Sweden nor Germany have stamped my passport, so there's no record in my passport to say I entered the Schengen zone today (since my time in Sweden was not counted).

A decision had not been made, but I was given the option to leave, as it was very nearly a rejection, and this way it's more likely to be accepted. 

Since I was required to leave, I asked if it was okay to leave Sweden and then come back on a tourist visa, which I was told yes it's fine. 
So with a statement ""I (name) Am officially leaving Sweden and therefore forfeitting my right to work and reside here"" I flew out of Sweden, to Germany. 
I gave my letter to passport officials, who then stamped it and took it. 

Here's the problem, they didn't stamp my passport, reason being I was flying to Germany, so there was no passport control when I was actually leaving the Schengen zone, which is why they stamped the letter  instead. 
When I arrived in Germany, they flicked through my passport and said ""you've overstayed your visa in Sweden, which means you were illegally there"" and I was like no no no no you don't understand...
They let me through, but didn't stamp my passport. 
So now, neither Sweden nor Germany have stamped my passport, so there's no record in my passport to say I entered the Schengen zone today (since my time in Sweden was not counted). And I am booked to fly back to Sweden as a tourist in four days, I'm terrified they will say ""according to your passport, you never left"" and ""sorry, you can't come back in"".

b84fxq,travel,I (23F) don't know if I'm ready to take a long trip through South America/Asia.,"TL;DR: Ever since I was in high school I had a dream of traveling the world. I now have the chance to, don't know if I'm ready, am super scared. 

So basically I have been dreaming of traveling the world ever since I was a teenager. My ultimate goal was to find a way to go on long trips, embrace new cultures and such. When I got to college, I still wanted this more than anything in the world. In the meantime, I developed a very deep depression and anxiety disorder.

Fast forward two years, I'm finally better, off meds and working on getting better everyday. I've been dealing with a lot of anxiety lately (probably because I know have to make a decision about my future), but other than that I can say that I'm fine.
I've finished college, my student loan is almost paid for.

Both me and my boyfriend (25M) work from home on a company that allows us to work remotely. We took a couple of 4-day trips around Europe, but we both had plans to move to Asia or South America for a few months, work remotely, and just travel.

I've been living with my boyfriend in his parents' house for about a year and a half. We started to want more privacy, our own place and such. We have finally found an apartment and it's almost certain that we can move there in a few weeks.
However, as this comes, I'm started to questioning whether or not we should move now, as we will probably just settle and never actually take this opportunity to travel. Our job is a freelance regime, and so it's possible that a year or two from now we won't be at this company anymore. 

I think the reason why we haven't actually done this yet is because I'm scared. I get anxious about a lot of things, like what if it doesn't work out, what if we get fired while so far away from home, etc.

But sometimes I just get this feeling that I gotta do this now or I'll probably never find such a great time to do it.

Today, I was looking around flights and I just got this huge urge to buy those tickets and simply go.
I feel like as much as I really want some privacy and independence, have our own home, our own routine, that is something we can do later, maybe a couple of years from now, whereas I don't know if I'll ever find the right conditions to simply travel.

My boyfriend is very supportive of my decisions, but we've been planning to travel for so long and just keep on delaying it, we both feel like it's just talk and we'll never actually do it. Also, it's always me with doubts and insecurities.

But now I really do have to decide, and I'm so confused. We wanted to live alone for so long, and we just found the perfect house. However, this is a long time dream for both of us.

b89ru0,travel,Advice needed: How to travel with people I don't like?,"FML I'm going on a trip with people who just don't like me. I think I'm a loud spoken person, who disagrees loudly and just makes a mess.

So I'm going to Georgia tomorrow in a 4 day trip with some of my work friends. Today they called me to come and plan Airbnb with them. They have lots of vanity, whereas I'm more of a moderate budget traveler. On one of the bookings, per head was coming out to be 78$ a night, and I opposed to it saying that let's cap it to $50 a night. But the guy started to give me excuses as to how the apartment had hot water (I'm sure every other apartment had it whether they listed on amenities or not). How the host was a super host and other bunch of random elements no one cares about when you're on a trip and booking the place just to leave your stuff and has a nice warm place to sleep in.

FML I'm going on a trip with people who just don't like me. I think I'm a loud spoken person, who disagrees loudly and just makes a mess.

So I'm going to Georgia tomorrow in a 4 day trip with some of my work friends. Today they called me to come and plan Airbnb with them. They have lots of vanity, whereas I'm more of a moderate budget traveler. On one of the bookings, per head was coming out to be 78$ a night, and I opposed to it saying that let's cap it to $50 a night. But the guy started to give me excuses as to how the apartment had hot water (I'm sure every other apartment had it whether they listed on amenities or not). How the host was a super host and other bunch of random elements no one cares about when you're on a trip and booking the place just to leave your stuff and has a nice warm place to sleep in.

b7v6ye,travel,Exploring Okinawa (Japan),"Earlier this month, I spent about a week island hopping around Okinawa (Japan).  Okinawa is the seldom visited chain of islands at the very southern end of Japan (just before you hit Taiwan).  Its sub-tropical, and many of the islands are sparsely populated.  I'd been to Japan (Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto) before several years ago, and wanted to see a part of Japan that gets relatively little tourism.

First, the album:  
https://imgur.com/a/f4jT2OI

Getting to Okinawa is really fairly easy.  There are multiple daily flights from elsewhere in Japan, plus Taiwan (Taipei) to the 'capital' (Naha) year round, and in the summer months there are even flights to the island of Ishigaki.  

I flew from Taipei to Naha (its an hour flight), and rented a car for the day to explore the 'main' island.  Driving was super easy (even though they drive on the left in Japan), and I drove all the way to the northern tip of the island, Cape Hedo.  About half the drive was on a modern multi-lane expressway (with toll booths, and rest stops), and the second half ran along the coast, through tiny fishing villages, and around/through large mountains.  There wasn't much traffic once I got off the expressway, and even at the cape, the parking area was mostly empty.  Granted this isn't peak tourist season, but I still doubt they get Tokyo style mobs of tourists.  On the drive back, I stopped at Nakagusuku Fortress, which is a 16th century stone fortress on a cliff overlooking the ocean.  Its a UNESCO site, and while there were other tourists there, it was far from crowded, and it was quite scenic to explore for an hour or so (granted a huge tour bus full of Chinese tourists pulled in just as I was leaving).

The next day, I hopped on a 40 minute flight down to the island (and city) of Ishigaki, which is basically the main population center for the southern most group of Okinawan islands.  From there, it was a 45 minute bus ride from the airport to the port where all the ferries to the other islands depart.  The bus was easy to figure out (there's a tourist booth in the airport arrivals hall where a helpful lady who spoke excellent English gave me the info).  

My plan for that day was to explore the island (and town) of Taketomi (population ~325), which was a quick 10 minute ferry away. Buying the ferry ticket was super easy (they even took credit cards, and everyone spoke basic English).  The ferry terminal kinda felt like a modern bus station, except it was spotless, bustling with people, and no homeless people.  Taketomi is the 'touristy' island, where most people go on day trips to explore the beaches, jungle, and quaint rocky walled village.  I opted to spend the night so that I didn't have the pressure of catching the last ferry of the day, and could really fully explore the island.  There are maybe half a dozen guest houses on the island, but its surprisingly affordable for Japan (in fact, all of Okinawa is much less expensive than 'mainland' Japan).   Taketomi was super cute, and I rented a bicycle which made the entire island very accessible. There were a lot of Asian day tourists, often traveling in huge packs of bicycles, but it wasn't awful. I saw small pristine sandy beaches, dense jungle, butterflies, tropical flora, and random cats wandering about.  Food was delicious (lots of seafood, pork & ramen).

The following day, I caught an early ferry back to Ishigaki, then turned right around, and bought a ticket for the next ferry to Kuroshina (Kuro Island).  Kuroshima (population ~250) is everything that Taketomi isn't.  Almost no tourists at all, not many beaches, and not much of anything other than farms & cows.  There are maybe 3 guesthouses, and half a dozen tiny cafes.  Also, its a flat island.  Why did I go to an island with nothing to do, and not even much scenery?  Cause I could, and how many people get to see a part of Japan that is the complete opposite of what every Western tourist imagines Japan is like?  My guesthouse let me borrow a bike for the day, and I literally rode around every tiny road on the island.  I checked out the lighthouse, the random few beaches, the few areas with dense forest, and saw many many cows & friendly farmers.  I also saw a lot of cats.  For some reason, there are a lot of cats on Kuroshima.  BTW, the sun down there is no joke.  I learned the hard way that sun burn is intense if you spend an entire day biking around on Kuroshima.  Its again not a large island, and I covered all of it in about 5-6 hours of exploring.

The day after that, the guesthouse gave me a 5 minute ride back to the port (they're on the other side of the island, which was a 45 minute walk for me).  I took the ferry back to Ishigaki, turned around yet again, and caught the next ferry to Iriomote island (Uehura port).  This was the long haul.  The ferry took nearly an hour, and Iriomote is a relatively large island, with very dense jungle, & rugged mountains.  The majority of the population is on the east & northern coasts, and the rest is just thick impenetrable jungle.  I did make 1 small mistake in my plans.  My guesthouse was about ~4km from the port, and I assumed that I'd just get a bus or taxi.  There's actually a public bus route that would have gotten me 99% of the way, except i managed to miss the bus by 20 minutes, and somehow the next bus wasn't for another 3 hours.  I'm guessing the bus schedule is designed to work best for locals going to/from work or school, as there are 2 buses in the morning and 2 in late afternoon, and that's it for the day.  There were no taxis anywhere.  So I decided to walk.  Of course this is the island that isn't flat, and it was mid-day semi-tropical heat.  Not the most enjoyable part of the trip.  I mostly did nothing for the rest of that day (sat in the shade watching people playing on a beach), although I did go to a fantastic Izakaya (about a 20 minute walk from the guesthouse) that was nothing but locals.  The TV above the bar had a live sumo wrestling match playing, and everyone else there clearly new the proprietor, and were toasting each other.  The following morning I had booked a guided kayak-hiking tour to Pinaisara (Old Man Beard Falls), which is the tallest waterfall in all of the Okinawan islands.  They picked me up from the guesthouse, and took me to their shop where they provided water shoes & life vest, and then drove everyone about 20 minutes south into the jungle to the edge of a mangrove swamp.  From there, everyone split into kayaks, and we headed off down the river through the mangrove swamp.  After about 40 minutes of kayaking, we landed, and then spent the next hour hiking up the side of the mountain, through the jungle to reach the top of the falls.  It wasn't an easy hike, extremely steep in places, but our guide did a great job (good English too).  At the top, we walked into the river, just a short distance from the edge of where the falls plunged about 55 meters.  The brave laid down and looked over the edge.  I was happy enough just being up there, where we could see all the way out to the sea, and the entire route that we kayaked just an hour earlier.  Our guide then busted out an amazing spread from his bag, and made everyone fresh ramen for lunch.  After there, we retraced our steps back down the mountain, then hiked another 20 minutes to the base of the falls, where anyone interested could go for a swim.  Then hiked back to the kayaks, 40 minutes kayaking back to the launch point, and then back in their van into town.

That was basically it for me in Okinawa.  They dropped me off at the ferry port, I caught the next ferry back to Ishigaki, then a bus to the airport, then my flight back up to Naha where I spent the night, before flying to Taipei the following morning.  So that was 5 different islands, but there are a bunch of others that I could have explored too, if I had more time.

I'm happy to answer any questions.  I've written a far more detailed trip report here:

b80jew,travel,Going to Bali this year with my wife and 3-year old son (three weeks) - need suggestions for places/towns to stay in.,"Hi all
This is our fourth time to Bali, so we are not completely new to everything, but we just feel like we need some suggestions on where to stay, since we tend to go to the same places everytime (more or less). 

We have stayed in the following places on previous visits (and some notes on each place):

- Seminyak - liked it and might go back this year for a few days after arriving in the airport (convenient)
- Sanur - not going back
- Nusa Dua - plan on ending the trip here for some luxury before the homebound flight
- Ubud - have always liked it, but feel like it's getting a bit more crowded than what we like
- Munduk (loved it - maybe not enough to do/see with a toddler)
- Padang Bai (not going back)
- Gili Islands - how is it now after the earthquake last year?

Ideally we like a place (or some places) that is not too quiet (different eating options and stuff like that), has stuff to do/see that is not too far away from the hotel/villa and if there is a nice beach nearby that is of course just a plus. 

We looked at Canggu and would also like to hear, if we should go out west - is there anything to do out there apart from snorkelling/diving?

I'll be renting a car and doing a self-tour from Glasgow to Isle of Skye and returning the car to Edinburgh. Right now I'm trying to figure out my must-see list. For example, I know I should check out Loch Ness, but it's so vast, that I'm trying to narrow down to one or two locations.

**Some questions!**

I'm planning on using Uber when going from the airport to my hostel/airbnb. Is ridesharing reliable/safe in Glasgow? I'm bringing a rolling checked bag, so I'm not sure how easy that would be to travel with on a train or a bus. The rest of the time, I'm planning on using public transit in Glasgow and Edinburgh.

I think I'm set for everything else, but if I've overlooked anything, or if you have any recommendations (attractions, food, etc) please let me know. Thank you! :)","Heading to Scotland in less than a week! Could I get opinions on my 11 day itinerary? Okay, it's technically 12 days— But I'm not counting the last day because I leave at 8 AM :P

I've been looking forward to Scotland for a while, but I'm completely overwhelmed by all there is to see! I've had to be a bit hard with what I can do with the time I have (without rushing), and get a good mix of city life and scenery, so I've narrowed it down as best I could. I was hoping to get some opinions on whether or not I'm on the right track:

b7ziz2,travel,Previous Flight's Weather Delay - Is It Justifiable?,"I had a nightmare experience last October, from IAD - LAX with American Airline. We had about 6.5 hrs delay, and they just told us the weather was the problem. The problem was, Washington DC's weather that day was actually really good. Then they later told us that the aircraft we were supposed to take was heavily delayed from the previous flight, and so as ours.

&#x200B;

This is American Airline's delay policy: ""If the delay or cancellation is caused by events beyond our control (like weather) you are responsible for your own overnight accommodations, meals and incidental expenses. American Airlines agents may be able to help you find a hotel."" And other major airlines across the world have the similar delay accommodation policy.

&#x200B;

I have realized that when a single flight is delayed, all the next couple of flights are delayed due to a domino effect. However, I think it is airline companies' responsibility to lessen domino effects. I would like to use Asiana Airline as an example of domino effect, explicitly. Asiana Airline is known to operate too many flights despite having limited number of aircraft. When there was a maintenance problem on one of their A380 aircraft at LAX, the next dozens of flights were delayed from 1 to 5 hours for the whole week! Their customers had to experience the delay caused by an engine failure happened a whole week before their actual flight. In contrast, Korean Air, who operates the exact same route (LAX - ICN), only has the domino effect lasting for a day or two. Probably it was Asiana Airline's fault for operating their flight for a whole week, non-stop. 

&#x200B;

Returning back to my experience with American Airline, if they pulled out their extra aircraft from their aircraft hangar and operated it for us, probably we would have experienced 2 or 3 hours of delay, instead of 6.5 hours. Others may argue that American Airline is still not obligated to take all their responsibilities, as the delay was essentially caused by bad weather. What is your opinion? Would it be airline companies' responsibility for the domino effect? And will I be able to receive accommodations? What if the delay was not caused by a weather problem, but within airline companies' responsibility, just like the Asiana Airline case from above?","Previous Flight's Weather Delay - Is It Justifiable?

b7ry1p,travel,What minimum trip length justifies a 13-25 hour flight?,"TL;DR: What is the shortest length of time you'd want to spend in a place that takes you a 13 hour flight to get there, with a 12-14 hour time difference? What if it was a 25 hour flight? 

Background: My husband and I have a limited amount of vacation days, and don't want to wait until an unknown future time years away before we can do a trip to Asia. But he is leaning towards Thailand or Vietnam (23-27+ hours flight time with one stop) and I am leaning towards Japan (13 hours flight time direct). 

My husband only wants to take 5 days off work, so with M-F off and weekends on both sides, that sounds like a half decent amount of time until you factor in the time the flights take and the 12-14 hour time difference. He seems unconcerned, but I feel like we'd MAYBE only have 5 days of good vacation (if that) that aren't spent exhausted from the flights and time difference. 5 good days doesn't seem worth a 25 hour flight. But I think we could manage it for a 13 hour flight. 

I'm trying to convince him that we should take 6-7 days off work instead of 5 to make it even more worthwhile, especially because it's not like we want to be staying in one place the entire trip (taking trains or short flights elsewhere in the country), but he has less vacation time than I do so it's hard to push the issue. My other arguments are that if we do Japan first, that will be a good primer for how much time we feel like we need to get over jet lag so that when we do subsequent trips to Thailand or Vietnam we will have a better sense of how long of a trip to take. 

Side note: I realize that a weeklong trip to anywhere in Asia from the US is really short and we'd only be able to see a small part of our chosen destination. But ""tomorrow is no guarantee"" and YOLO and all that jazz.

I am trying to decide between traveling solo to either South America (Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina) or Southeast Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, etc.). I have never been to either region. Budget restrains are not a huge concern. I plan on staying in hostels throughout the entire trip. Would love to hear from people who have been to both places and hear what they have really enjoyed. 

As far as my interests, I really enjoy almost anything to do with history (I loved traveling through Europe and seeing the museums and historical sights). Love learning about other cultures. I am not super into outdoor hiking, but I can definitely find enjoyment in it, although I would probably rather spend the time at the beach. I also enjoy partying (although likely less than I used to) and enjoy meeting others from around the world. I do find Latin nightlife pretty appealing. I am not fluent in Spanish but I know enough to get around and hold some basic conversations. I love spicy food. 

What do you guys think? Looking for some extra opinions. Don't really think I can go wrong, but figured I would ask.

* Belgrade, Serbia - Start Point
* Sarajevo, B&H - Arrive by bus from Belgrade.

* Ohrid, North Macedonia - Bus from Tirana.
* Skopje, North Macedonia - Bus from Ohrid. End of trip.

It's quite frankly a lot. But I've planned roughly what I want to do in each location and how long I want to spend (with spare days for flexibility).

b7q4dz,travel,Everest Base Camp Trek - A few questions!,"Hi all,

A friend and I are heading to Nepal from April 19 - May 7. Those are the dates we land in Kathmandu and fly off. We are planning on doing the Everest Base Camp Trek ourselves (no guide/porters), and we'd like to prepare as much beforehand prior to landing in Nepal so we can hit the ground running and begin the trek as soon as possible. We are aware that while possible in the timeframe we're in Nepal for, weather and altitude often make EBC trek times unpredictable. There were a few items we'd like clarified, and thank you very much in advanced!

1. **Flight to Lukla:** We'd like to book flights on April 21st as early in the day as possible to avoid any inclement weather. The most common ways of booking flights are through Nepalese agencies or online through the various airlines websites. When I go to the Yeti Airlines website, it says there are no flights available. Does anybody have experience booking flights either way, and if with an agency, could you recommend an agency in Nepal to book with?
2. **Return flight:** Would you recommend booking a return flight from Lukla to Kathmandu before hand, or waiting until you've returned from EBC and are more certain of when you'll be ready to fly back?
3. **Permits and TIMs card:** Similar with the flight, is it possible to book these prior to landing in Nepal and picking them up somewhere? We'd like to mitigate any time spent in Nepal getting this stuff in order so we can explore Kathmandu and fly to Lukla.
4. **Altitude medication:** Apparently it's possible to purchase altitude medication (i.e. Diamox alternatives) in Kathmandu. Does anybody have any experience with this?
5. **Other medication:** What other medication would you recommend bringing? Immodium, antibiotics and altitude medication are the three I've added to my list.
6. **Is a sleeping bag required?** We will be staying in teahouses, and while these can get chilly in the evenings (especially higher up), is a sleeping bag really needed? I believe the teahouses provide blankets and such.

Any other tips and advice would be much appreciated as well. Thanks again /r/travel!","Everest Base Camp Trek - A few questions! Hi all,

b7sodz,travel,Having trouble getting the most out of our Eurail passes — am I missing something?,"My boyfriend and I are 6 days into a 36 day trip in Europe. We bought two global month long first class passes to travel Europe. We came here with a loose idea of what we wanted to see, but no set itinerary. The reason we bought these specific passes were to be able to have the flexibility of “winging it” across Europe. 

So far, we are having a negative experience and are starting to feel buyers remorse for spending almost $1500 on these damn tickets. I will take the fault for not doing further research into the fine print, but we really were convinced that this was going to save us time and money on the trip. Not the case. Many attendants at “partnered” train companies with Eurail have no idea what this pass is. Many more trains and trams are not included in the pass. Some companies will offer discounts on tickets because of the pass, but it still doesn’t seem like we will save the money we spent by buying the passes in the first place. 

We have tickets booked tomorrow to Paris, and have already read on multiple blogs that these passes are nearly useless in France despite what the app and guide say...

So my question is, does anyone have any tips for using these passes, or just public transportation in general? Did we fuck up by buying these?


TL;DR — Struggling to get our moneys worth with the Eurail passes, don’t know if it was really worth the purchase.

I know we are probably staying a little too long in Sydney, but we are an LGBT couple and from what I understand, Sydney is a great place to visit! The weather looks to be a bit cooler during late April/May, but should still be a pleasant time.

&#x200B;

**SYDNEY**

Not sure which area we are staying in Sydney yet, if anyone has recommendations. We will probably stay in a hostel or Airbnb.

* April 22 - Sydney

* April 24 - Sydney
* April 25 - Sydney
* April 26 - Sydney

**ROCK**

We are doing the Rock tour - the cost isn’t that expensive and we are seeing everything we want without having to spend a fortune on accommodations and the hassle of doing everything ourselves.

* April 27 - Fly to Yulara (found an $80 flight, arrive in afternoon), begin Rock tour day 1 (Ayers Rock base walk, see cave paintings, sunset)
* April 28 - Rock tour day 2 (Sunrise over Ayers Rock, Kata Tjuta)
* April 29 - Rock tour day 3 (King’s Canyon, arrive in Alice Springs at night)

* April 30 - Flight to Cairns ($390) **-** arrive in evening
* May 1 - Cairns 1
* May 2 - Cairns 2 - Great Barrier Reef tour with Silverswift (this seemed to be the best from my research)
* May 3 - Cairns 3
* May 4 - Fly back at 5pm

b7rwda,travel,Turkey Tips and advice,"Hey 

My wife and I are planning a July Summer Holiday and thinking about going to the Turkish Riviera(Antalya, Side or Alanya). There seems to be many 5* Hotels that are not that expensive, what’s the catch here? And would it be worthwhile to do All inclusive or to just have Breakfast and then enjoy Restaurants?

 I would love to do the Hot Air Balloons while there as well, but I’ve read it happens more in the center of the country than the coast, is this true? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Does this make sense to fly and rent vs driving from NC? the cost is like 5x but would allow more time on the trip not driving. Either way I'll have to pay parking fees at the resort for the week so thats already a given.

It would be 5 days in Tokyo, bullet-training to Kyoto, then another 5 days in Kyoto. (If its too much 10 days in Tokyo would be fine but this is what we're aiming for.)

1)What hotels could you get with a budget of around 200 a night for 2 people? (I know some hotels also don't allow under 18s but some do and/or require parental contest forms to be signed before checking-in). Private toilets/bathrooms are a must.

2)Is it possible to leave from a different airport. I know it is possible but i'm sure that parental consent has to be given at the airport at departure and on a return flight I'm sure that this consent would transfer over but on 2 one way flight, either end, from different locations, would consent be needed?

3) is 4k enough? we're not going to spend tons on flashy events and will spend most of our time sight-seeing in mostly free areas. Food: while we will eat out we aren't planning to every night and will probably just eat 7-11 snacks some nights. I've budgeted like this so far:

Flights: £1.2k, Lodgings: £2.3k, Food: £300, Spending: £400

b7jc62,travel,Italy in August for 12 days,"Hey all, just wanted some opinions on my itinerary for my trip to Italy with my wife in August.

Flying into Rome - 1 day possibly 2 if we enjoy it. 

Not huge tourist attraction people, we want to see the main stuff like the coliseum, fountain, maybe the Vatican or a church or two.

Rome to Salerno (train)- 5 days 

Staying in Salerno, but taking day trips around the area. Going to head into the Amalfi coast, positano and Capri for day trips, as well as possibly Naples.

Salerno to Alberobello Puglia (not sure how we are travelling yet, possibly rental car) - 6 days in two different Airbnb locations

Puglia back to Rome (train) and home the next morning 

We love low key areas and natural beauty, we are spending a decent amount of time in Puglia to experience more authentic Italy with less tourism, plus its beautiful there.

Any tips or suggestions? How to deal with the heat? How much cooler does it feel on the coasts? We expect Rome to be brutal with the weather and are hoping the rest will be more manageable.

Thanks :)

b7kn5f,travel,Are cameras still alive ?,"Im about to head off to thailand for 10 days in about a month or two.
And i faced a deeper question.
Its a simple question really with a not so simple answer.
Should. I. Bring. A. Camera?

Well here is my 2 cents on the matter.

You see last time i went to thailand was 10 years ago. And smartphones wernt a thing then.
 I enjoyd the trip probebly 10864 times more then i enjoy trips today with my phone in my pocket at all times. 
I had a great dslr camera which took some amazing pictures, 
and yea it was a pain to carry but eventually i sattled down on a pocket sized camera that was also amazing. 

The thing is that with my samsung galaxy s8, or with my friends iphone xs, the picture quality that they can take is not less then amazing, i agree not as good as a good dslr camera or even not as good as some pocket size cameras, but its always with u, dont need to charge etc...

And here we face some of the issues with that.
You see when u have an external camera and your taking shots with it, there is a sense of i dont know how to explain it better then just say ""magic"" when you review the pictures.

You remember them. You go over each one deciding what to keep. 
It creates good memories

As where with the iphone you take a picture of anything becaouse its so avilable, and that magic i dont know if fades but get cluttered up in a digital mess of 2000 pictures,

Not to talk on the fact that you already have your phone out when u review the pictures so you might as well check gmail, fb, and other trip ruining, friendship reuining apps that take away from your expiriance of being in a trip with your loved ones having fun .

Its not so much of a ""vacation"", when your phone is out and your so availble like at home.

And then on the other hand
Not brining your phone means you let go of maps, ubber, and reservstion details on the fly.

Maybe its just an old man grunting on not being able to adept to this new world,

I think ill sattle down on buying a gopro for allot of video making, 
plus with my drone i can have some great video in the end, and ill minimize the pictures taken to a minimum. 
Maybd thats the sulotion for me. Hellci dont know.. 

Whats your thoughts in the matter ?

I’m looking for some info, search tips(what to look for and what to avoid), best locations, etc. I think we’re leaning Europe/Scandinavia but is it worth it to fly to Europe and board there or catch a cheaper one that leaves America and spend like 5 days going across the Atlantic. That feels like a waste of time on a boat and not sightseeing but it’s seems so much cheaper. I’d say our top limit per person is $2000.  I hope this isn’t to vague but the more info I get the better questions I’ll ask later.

b7hlnd,travel,The die is cast - I am going to Rome in the fall for five nights. How is this itinerary?,"[Following up from this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/af2whd/looking_to_make_an_offseason_trip_to_rome_how/) Five nights it is, and there won't be much time on the travel days (although we might be able to squeeze something in on the night we get there). This leaves four full days on the ground. Since neither of us have ever been to Rome, how is the following?

**Day 1**

* Pantheon

* San Luigi dei Francesi

* Sant'Agnese in Agone

**Day 2**

* Coliseum

* Palatine Hill

* Altar of the Fatherland

* Capitoline Museum

* Trajan's Column

**Day 3**

* Train to/from Florence

* Duomo di Firenze

* Galleria dell'Accademia

**Day 4**

* Vatican (St. Peter's Basilica, Museums)

* Trastevere

Day two is a Sunday, so no churches. I tried to group things geographically so that we are not having to walk large distances against the clock to fit things in. The Trevi Fountain can be fit in pretty much anywhere with these groupings, as I anticipate having to wake up at a weird hour to see it regardless.

Also I wonder if it would be reasonable to condense some of the above and take a day to go south to Pompeii or the Amalfi Coast. If we do not do something like that, then I expect to have room to improvise on most of these days.","The die is cast - I am going to Rome in the fall for five nights. How is this itinerary?

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/g6pt4bl61cp21.png

And I figured since I haven't been to London/Paris, it made sense to fly into London (cheapish flight), Paris is close, etc. On the Switzerland leg, after Geneva I'd like to take a scenic train to Milan.

&#x200B;

On vacation, I really just like to walk around, take in the sights, and eat lots of food. Past the partying scene but some beers would be cool. Not an all-day museum guy, though I will hit some. Trying to mix urban with rural, trains with flights to get a good mix. It is skewed pretty urban on this trip so I'm open to suggestions on how to change that. I am willing to drop London on this trip (fly into Paris first instead) in order to get more rural France/Switzerland/Italy time if anyone has suggestions.

&#x200B;

Trying to avoid too many 6-8hr train rides though, one would be fine perhaps..

Cost is not a primary issue but I'm trying to avoid hotels in favor of hostels/Airbnb...

I really want to go on another biking holiday but try another country. I enjoyed Vietnam because it was cheap (food, beer and accom), warm, friendly and relatively small which made exploring easier and could experience more variety in the terrain.

&#x200B;

What are your suggestions for a similar experience without goig back to Vietnam? I really like the idea of going to some beaches, surfing, trail riding, as well as meeting other travellers in places like hostels.

&#x200B;

I have heard some good stuff about Sri Lanka but haven't done much research on it yet.

&#x200B;

Any advice much appreciated! :)","Deciding where to go on my next motorbike holiday Hey guys!

b7hb7w,travel,Looking for help on travel between South Korea and U.S.,"Hello, 

I'm 24, and plan to travel soon to South Korea to visit my family. I have both South Korean and American passports because I was born in South Korea to a South Korean mother and American father. I obtained American citizenship and my passport through my father. I currently live in U.S. as my family moved here; I plan to travel back to see grandparents. I am worried about purchasing tickets. 

I am aware of the law that requires dual nationals to select one citizenship by 22; I am afraid of getting either citizenship taken away by traveling back. My American passport, for example sake, says my name as John Smith. On other hand, my Korean passport list my name as Kim Minso. I know U.S. has no exit immigration, but I do not know how to purchase a ticket. My worry is if I buy a ticket under my American passport, I will have difficulty leaving Korea once I get there with my Korean passport. If I check into the airport counter with my Korean passport, will the TSA stop me when my ticket name does not match with my American passport? Will same thing happen if I use my American name and try to leave Korea with Korean passport? Please help. ","Looking for help on travel between South Korea and U.S. Hello,

b7djyc,travel,Desert tours on Morroco (tips/advices),"I seek for some advice from experienced users who have done a desert tour before. I would like to see the sandy desert with the magnificent sand dunes we are used to see on those promotional tours, ride the camels and perhaps doing some sandboarding. However there are a lot of offers and some of them doesn't seem to be as wonderful as they are advertised. From the search I've conducted so far, Zagora is dry stone desert...I'm not interested in this one. On the other way Merzouga seems to be the right deal for me. I seek for the normal stuff, transportation back and forth from Marrakech, night stay, and meals. Hence, I would like to be linked to a tour both affordable and trustable. TripAdvisor links are more than welcome for example. 
Please notice that I'm an European citizen and this is my first time leaving Europe... so I would like to hear more from other people who went through the same experience and perhaps having some proper advice. 
 I will be waiting for your feedback. Thanks a lot","Desert tours on Morroco (tips/advices) I seek for some advice from experienced users who have done a desert tour before.

I know there will be the Norwegian Constitution Day celebration the day of our arrival. We will most likely enjoy that the first day in Bergen and then we would like to head out to see Fjords and some hiking. We are not overly interested in cities. My great great grandparents are from Flam and Nese So those are on our list. I've done some research online and am overwhelmed by everything I would like to see.

b7cm4g,travel,Planning a two week trip in Western Europe for early May. Itinerary review please?,"Hello everyone. A friend and I (both 23M, Canada) are planning a two week visit to Western Europe from May 1st to May 14th and wondering if there are any tips or suggestions based on our itinerary. Any help is appreciated!

*Background Info*

- We are both 23M from Canada. We both speak English and some decent French.

- We have both been to Paris so we will only visit attractions we have missed out on before.

- I am not much of a party-type so mostly looking for quiet hostels to get good sleep.

- I do have a small solo Europe travel experience while my friend does not.

- I am really interested in museums and history while my friend wants to go ""wherever"".

**Itinerary**

May 1st: Arrive at 6:35AM in London. Explore Hyde Park and Big Ben. Visit Buckingham Palace in the afternoon (is it worth it?)

May 2nd: National Gallery in the morning, Westminster Abbey in later in the afternoon and London Eye before sunset (quite expensive ticket. once again, is it worth it?)

May 3rd: British Museum for as long as we can and head over to Tower Bridge later. 

May 4th: Try walking around and exploring around Picadilly and Trafalgar? There are many free museums to kill time in. Take a 7:34 PM train to Brussels and arrive at 10:38 PM.

May 5th: Explore the city of Brussels around the Grand Palace. Indulge on chocolate, waffles, fries and beer.

May 6th: Day trip to Bruges using Go Pass 10. Any specific attractions we should go into or is a walk around town and maybe a canal boat ride enough?

May 7th: Day trip to Ghent using Go Pass 10. Same as Bruges. Any specific attractions?

May 8th: Take a train from Brussels to Paris and arrive at 10:33AM. I originally thought of doing a day trip to Antwerp but didn't see much that attracted me so added an extra day to Paris. Also the reason why I went London->Brussels instead of London->Paris is because Eurostar tickets to Paris around this time were crazy expensive. Anyways, arrive in Paris and head to Pont Neuf, Notre Dame and Jardin Luxembourg. Go up the Eiffel Tower in late afternoon.

May 9th: Activate a 48hour Museum Pass and visit the Versailles (which I missed out on the last time!). How many hours will I need there?

May 10th: Go up the Arc de Triomphe in the morning and come down Champs-Elisees to Pont Alexandre III and Place de Concorde. What would be the best use of the Museum Pass? I would love to visit Orsay or Louvre again for a few hours but have not visited Sainte-Chapelle or Pantheon. Take a train to Amsterdam at 6:19PM and arrive at 9:44PM.

May 11th: Anne Frank house, Royal Palace and canal boat ride. Anyone have experience with an I Amsterdam city card or the Holland pass? If so, how have you used them? Were they worth it?

May 12th: Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum. Canal boat ride again?

May 13th: Heineken experience? Guided walking tours? If we purchase a pass, there are so many options for this day.

May 14th: Take a plane back home at 10:00AM but with a long layover in Vienna. I know there is a lot to see in Vienna, but with less than one full day, what is something we really have to do there? I am thinking of going around Old Vienna and getting peaks at the Rathaus, Opera House and St. Stephen's Cathedral. Maybe a visit to the Schonbrunn Palace if time permits (doubt it)?

May 15th: Take a plane back home for real this time at 10:40AM.

So that is London, Brussels, Bruges, Ghent, Paris, Amsterdam and Vienna in 14 days. A very short period of time but Paris had been visited before and Vienna is only a layover. So are there any tips and suggestions? Thanks!","Planning a two week trip in Western Europe for early May. Itinerary review please? Hello everyone.

b7cklw,travel,Greek Honeymoon Questions,"My Fiancee and I are planning our honeymoon to Greece for September 17-25, and I was looking for a little conversation/input!  Here is our current thought for an itinerary. 

17th - Arrive in Athens at 1:10 PM, Stay at Attalos hotel this night. Only hotel booked so far

18th - Milos - Travel agency is quoting us Portiani hotel in Adamas, but I am seeing that Pollonia may be a better place.

19th - Milos - Thinking 2-3 islands, Milos/sifnos are probably must sees for us.

20th - Milos - 

21st - Sifnos - Travel agency quoted us the Benakis Hotel in Platys Gialos, but recommendations point towards Apollonia or Artemonas

22nd - Sifnos - 

23rd - Sifnos or Athens - 

24th - Athens this night - Travel Agency quoted us the Athens La Strada, open to suggestions

25th - Flight out of Athens at 8:35 AM

 As far as Athens goes, I was thinking at least the Acropolis, Plaka, possibly Sounion for sunset, and maybe Delphi. Looking for recommendations on how best to fit this in, or change. Thanks /u/umakanimike for the suggestions through other posts.

We definitely like a more low key destination, and the food, beaches, with adventure and/or historical sites mixed in is our style. Small hikes, good views, snorkeling/swimming, exploring the city, etc. Not so much looking for the night life or the super touristy stuff. Although, we thought about visiting santorini just for the caldera views, and Instagram-ness. We have since nixed that idea due to budget and wanting to escape the tourist trap. We are hoping to stay in the $2200-$3200 range for non airfare and first hotel night costs.

I apologize for the rambled thoughts and wall of text, but I will try to collect my thoughts with a few questions below.

1. My biggest question is how helpful is booking through a travel agency? I have heard mixed reviews and it seems like I could book cheaper myself, I am just worried about ferries and taxis.
2. Leading to...Is booking ferries online reliable? 
3. Is 3 days at each of those islands too much? Should we make another night in Athens before we leave?
4. Do you think we need to rent a car during any of our stays? Athens for Delphi/Sounion, or is taxi/tour possible? Milos looks big also. I am from the US, would I need a my IDP? 
5. Thoughts on renting scooters/ATV's?","Greek Honeymoon Questions My Fiancee and I are planning our honeymoon to Greece for September 17-25, and I was looking for a little conversation/input!  Here is our current thought for an itinerary.

I live in Texas and she lives in North Carolina and we’ve been to LA together and we both want to go somewhere not in the US mainland. We haven’t traveled that much, I went on a cruise with my family to Jamaica and a couple other islands; and went to Nigeria to visit family with my immediate family a couple times as a child. But that’s about it. Traveling is fairly new to me. I’ve been researching a lot, but I wanted advice on places to go to and maybe some tips since there’s experienced travelers on here. Here are our requirements:

- since we’re college students with part time jobs, we can’t go somewhere super expensive like Japan or Bora Bora, we want to spend around a max of $1,000 each on all expenses (not saying we’re dead broke, we have money saved up for a trip, but like I said, we don’t wanna go overboard and spend a semester’s tuition on 1 trip)

- we want to go somewhere with a beautiful beach and lots of daytime activities like snorkeling, scuba diving, boat tours, speedboats, hiking through/exploring forests, dune buggies, zip lining, seeing marine animals and land animals, etc. (doesn’t have to include all of this, just some examples of stuff we’d wanna do!) Since we’re 22, we also want to enjoy some great nightlife and eat great new food 

- we were thinking of either going in June or December (our only off times from school)

- and of course, we want to go somewhere that’s not very dangerous. I know crime is everywhere on the globe but there’s clearly some cities or countries that are going through different crises at the moment and we want to avoid going somewhere where we’re more worried about safety than relaxing and having fun

We don't mind a 5-10 minute cab to the downtown scene either.   


I've been looking at: 

\- Southern downtown (near Concordia/St. Catherines) 

\- Also a bit outside such as Old Montreal, Le Plateau, Ville-Marie.

I appreciate the help!","Best location to stay for a week in Montreal, QC? First time travelling here for us. I'll be with a few friends who are also in their 20s. We want nightlife but still a relaxing time as we'll be there 6 days. A Townhouse Airbnb (with a nice terrace patio/view in Old Montreal) is what we're leaning towards. We don't mind a 5-10 minute cab to the downtown scene either.   


I've been looking at: 

\- Southern downtown (near Concordia/St. Catherines) 

\- Also a bit outside such as Old Montreal, Le Plateau, Ville-Marie.

I am planning to visit Austria this summer. I need some help in finalizing some places. I intend to fly to Linz and take a car to visit the places.

My rough plan for 1 week:
Salzburg - 2 days
Berchtesgaden national park - 2 days (In Germany)
Halstatt - 1 day (may cancel as its overcrowded)
Bad Ischl - 1 day

We enjoy places with lake villages, castles, short hikes and any places with beautiful views of the Alps. I am flexible to include some places in my plan which suit our interests. We plan to avoid too crowded places and opt for quieter ones. 

Our starting and end point is Linz. I am also interested to stay one day in this beautiful cabin (https://dolomitenhuette.at/) but don't have much information at this stage. 

Any advice would be great. Thank you so much!

b7cwnq,travel,Travel Check - Peru over Christmas?,"Hey travellers,

I'm looking into booking a trip to Peru over the Christmas holidays. I've only ever been to Argentina in South America before, so my Peruvian knowledge is very limited. 

I'm still in the preliminary research phase, but would something like this be possible at all? 

&#x200B;

**Day 1: Arrive in Lima from Canada**

**Day 2: Lima** 

**Day 3: Bus to Cusco (all day Hop on/off bus) and stay overnight in Cusco** 

**Day 4: Train to Machu Picchu, stay in Cusco or Sacred Valley or nearbyish**

**Day 5: Christmas day in Cusco or wherever we stay nearby that area**

**Day 6: Bus back to Lima**

**Day 7: Fly back to Canada**

&#x200B;

I know it's a very short trip and ideally I would spend 2-3 weeks there, but I'm trying to keep it within my leftover vacation days at work :( 

**Is it possible:**

* To do one day at Machu Picchu?
* Will things be open in Cusco on Christmas Day? Is there a Christmas celebration on that day? It's totally ok if not, just curious
* What's the altitude sickness situation in Cusco if you take the bus up (I think it's about an 18 hour ride with 2 stops in smaller cities)? Could it be manageable to stay overnight there?

Another woman effected left for a hotel and they still charged her for the next few nights of her reservation so I decided to stay, especially because I trusted the people in the room but they didn’t offer a different room or hostel in their company umbrella hostels. I asked for compensation just for my built in lock suitcase and I was told to email the manager two nights ago, never heard back and had to check about before ever getting a response.

Nothing was actually taken but I’m now having to travel without safe bags and as a solo female traveler that’s not a great way to start off on a long trip.

We are hoping to stay in a hostel or airbnb for a few weeks, check in with friends and chill a bit, and buy a car or camper.

Our wish list is:

1. We’re based in the US, so we’d be looking for somewhere that isn’t prohibitively expensive or time-consuming to fly to. 
2. We have 3 kids aged 9-14 that we would like to keep busy for 7+ days without having to leave the hotel grounds every day. They make friends easily and stay happy with a pool/beach, especially if there are any additional water attractions, like slides or fountains.
3. A room with a master bedroom (for us parents) and enough room for the three kids to sleep in beds. They can share beds if there’s a queen and a pullout sofa, but we’d need some combination like that for them to be comfortable so they sleep well. We don’t really need much more than this, but it’s also not always a given that the parents have a private room.
4. Within walking/shuttle distance of a food court, preferably with a public seating area. We like to eat together, but almost never at the same place. We also prefer to eat away from the resort since it gives us something objective to do with little effort or stress.
5. We’d like to be within walking/shuttle distance of a beach we can swim at in December, but that’s not critical.
6. We've never done all-inclusive, but are open if there are recommendations that fit our other goals.

I found [this](https://www.garibaldilake.ca/garibaldi-bus) bus option through the official website but it looks like 12 might be too many gals for the date we are looking at going, as it won't let me book more than 6.

b6zoza,travel,Should i ignore Ryanair or AirHelp?,"Hi guys, almost a year ago I had a problem with a Ryanair flight, which was delayed, and so I sent many emails to Ryanair to try to get a compensation under the EU regulation 261/2004. They refused to offer me any compensation, and so I contacted AirHelp.   
AirHelp takes care of everything for us and asks for 25% of the compensation, if we receive it. However, Ryanair refused to pay, once again, even through them, and so AirHelp informed me that my complain was legit and they offered to go to court for another 25% of the possible compensation, which means 50% total of the compensation, which I accepted and authorized the AirHelp lawyers to act in my behalf. They also adverted me that it was possible that Ryanair would try to get in touch with me directly in order to offer me a smaller compensation, and that I should not reply to the email and forward it to AirHelp instead, in case that happened.   


Yesterday I did end up receiving an email from Ryanair offering me a compensation, but, instead  of a smaller one, as stated by AirHelp, they are offering the exact amount that I should be receiving. I think that Ryanair knows that they would lose in court and instead of dealing with AirHelp they probably prefer to pay me directly, possibly to decrease the success rate of AirHelp and decrease also the number of users using AirHelp.  (I think that it's probably easier for Ryanair to deal with us instead of the AirHelp lawyers, specially when refusing to give any compensation).   


So, what should I do? Should I accept the offer from Ryanair or forward the email to AirHelp, as they asked? Did the same thing happened to anyone? What happens if I accept the offer? Can AirHelp sue me for violationg the contract? My problem is that if I accept their offer, I receive 100% of the money, and if I choose to stay with AirHelp I'll only receive 50% of it.

I will only have hand luggage, and am travelling on a British passport with an ESTA. My flight into JFK (from arrives into terminal 8 at 9pm, and my flight out leaves Terminal 1 at 11pm. This is on a Monday. 

Do you think this will be enough time? As I'm arriving domestic and departing intl I'm hoping that's a teeny bit quicker than the other way would be, and I'll have no baggage to wait for.

Any advice would be helpful!

b6rkym,travel,Advice Needed: Two Weeks in Ireland,"My wife and I are traveling to Ireland for two weeks in July, and although I have a lot of travel under my belt, I don't have as strong a sense for what I want to see there as I might for other countries. The only thing set in stone is that we fly into Dublin and plan to spend a few days there first. We'll definitely rent a car. For pace, I don't think we necessarily want to be moving to a new hotel every night, but a mix of one-nighters and two-to-three nighters is ideal. I want to see a good bit of the country because I don't really plan on going to Ireland again (only so many vacations a man gets).

For itinerary, I've heard great things about the west coast: the Dingle peninsula and Ring of Kerry, for example. We probably want at least 3, but maybe more days of really nice day hikes (5-8 miles, but could do more, bring a light backpack, finish and drink a beer at the bar, time to shower and have a good dinner--either loop hikes or easy transportation back to the hotel/starting point). Skellig Michael seems cool unless people here say it's totally overrated. I love castles; my wife can probably handle a couple but not too many. Cute towns to wander through, of course. I'd also like to see the Cliffs of Moher, but I don't know how feasible it is to cover the entire west coast without stressing--this is our first vacation without the baby, so I know my wife will want to sleep in. I'd also like to do some distillery tour or whisky tasting that isn't Jameson. Good food is a must, and if there are some bars with great Irish/folk music, of course that. If there are places in the center/east of Ireland you recommend, I'm all ears.

Thank you in advance for your tips!","Advice Needed: Two Weeks in Ireland My wife and I are traveling to Ireland for two weeks in July, and although I have a lot of travel under my belt, I don't have as strong a sense for what I want to see there as I might for other countries.

2. Will my bags be checked due to me not being a citizen of said countries?

On December I had a flight booked with Wow air to visit my family, when I arrived to the airport I was denied boarding as the flight was overbooked (I was not the one who bought the tickets, so I couldn't check in online) and basically had to stay one night at the airport.

The next day, the company rescheduled my flight and added an extra connection, so my final flight was Toronto-Keflavik-London-Barcelona. It took me 2 days to reach my destination and I missed a wedding (I was the bridesmaid).

I used airhelp to make my claim and by mid-February I was told that my claim had been approved and that they'd contact me soon to discuss the details of the compensation.

It's been over a month and I hadn't received any update so I decided to check their social media only to discover that the company's going bankrupt. 

My claim has already been approved but I guess I won't be getting any compensation.

b6rxcp,travel,Europe carry on vs check luggage,"Any advise on carry on vs check luggage for a 2 week trip to Europe? I will not be washing any cloths, so I do need enough outfits for 2 weeks without washing. I could probably fit all the outfits in either bag, but I just won’t have any room left for anything extra in the carry on.  Most people on my trip say they are carrying on. Carrying on is easy to haul around Europe rather than a large check bag, and I won’t have to worry about my luggage in the airport’s hands. But a smaller bag fits way less, plus small travel sized toiletries in a carry on bag. I could fit everything I need plus souvenirs in a check bag but really don’t want to haul a large bag all around Europe. Any advise would be great thanks. ","Europe carry on vs check luggage Any advise on carry on vs check luggage for a 2 week trip to Europe? I will not be washing any cloths, so I do need enough outfits for 2 weeks without washing. I could probably fit all the outfits in either bag, but I just won’t have any room left for anything extra in the carry on.  Most people on my trip say they are carrying on. Carrying on is easy to haul around Europe rather than a large check bag, and I won’t have to worry about my luggage in the airport’s hands. But a smaller bag fits way less, plus small travel sized toiletries in a carry on bag.

I'm planning a trip to China this fall and would love to visit one of the two places - Zhangjiajie and Lijiang. Unfortunately, going to both is not an option. Both places I've heard they are quite popular with the Chinese but appears to be not as popular (relatively) with westerners. I would like to get some opinions on which place I should go to.

My husband and I love walking around and exploring. We like to be on the go and seeing new things all the time. Not a great big fan of sitting around and just chilling. Which from sound of it that's what Lijiang's like? Any thoughts/input would be greatly appreciated! Especially if you have been to both.

b6mgkz,travel,15-Day Europe Itinerary: Paris to Rome to Amalfi Coast (Comments/Suggestions?),"My friend and I are going to Europe for the first time at the end of May. We'll be meeting some friends about halfway through. We are just looking to explore, experience new cultures, and eat and drink (for cheap)! Below is the itinerary, let me know if this looks realistic or if you have any suggestions for good food/places to see! Thank you!

&#x200B;

Day 1: Land in Paris in the morning. Take a cab to the hostel in Belleville. Take the train to see the eiffel tower/arc de triomphe/notre dame. Explore/eat around there, then come back to Belleville to go out to bars at night.

Day 2: Go to the Louvre early in the morning, get lunch somewhere in the Tuileries Gardens. Then either go back into the Louvre or continue to explore the area. At night, most likely will go out to bars in Belleville again.

Day 3: Take a train to Versailles to explore the gardens for free. Not sure what to do with the rest of this day. We'll take the night train at 8pm to Milan, then another 2 hour train to Genoa.

Day 4: Once we arrive in Genoa at 8am, we'll take a bus or cab to our hotel in Portofino. We found a cheap little hotel right by the beach. Spend the day walking around the town (not buying anything because we can't afford it haha) just taking photos, and then relaxing by the beach. 

Day 5: Another day just relaxing on the beach. At some point later we'll get a cab/bus to Rapallo and take the train to Pisa then Florence. We're not sure where we're staying there yet, but we'd like to maybe stay somewhere a bit outside the city that's still accessible by a cheap cab.

Day 6: We'd love to do a wine tour! Still trying to find the right one. At the end of the day we'll take the train to Rome and meet our friends at the hostel.

Day 7: Rome 

Day 8: Rome

Day 9: Spend the morning in Rome then take the train to Naples, then to our Air bnb in Sorrento

Day 10: Sorrento

Day 11: Sorrento

Day 12: Take the train to Pompeii, stay in in Air bnb there that night

Day 13: Not sure where to go from here!

Day 14: Still up in the air!

Day 15: Fly out of Rome

b6h0pa,travel,Feeling weird after 5 years traveling the globe,"Hello all,

&#x200B;

I spent the last 5 years living and traveling around the world, it was a long time dream, a bit of a destiny. Spent countless hours in the past staring at maps and wondering what would it be to go here or there, so finally I packed my things and off I went. Years went by exploring our great world and one day I started feeling that it was enough, I had done as much traveling as I wanted, and it felt good to go back home.

&#x200B;

So, I came back. It does feel good indeed to be here, having all the comforts and a small routine, I couldn't complain the slightest. Also I don't consider any traveling in the short/mid or even long term for now. But I can't help myself with this strange feeling of resuming my life. My brain can't get around the fact that this is it, I'm back now. I left, and now I'm back, as silly as it sounds. Something that was a dream and a lifegoal pursuit only a few years ago became already part of the past now.

&#x200B;

It's a bit of a void that I'm left with, as if I need something new to look for now. Mind you, I've got plenty going on and part of my current projects are the reason why I felt it was the right time to come back. There's absolutely no regrets, only good memories and dare I say something of an empty soul, perharps ?

&#x200B;

This is only a splash of my thoughts in the hopes that maybe someone else here can relate to my words and also wants to talk about it.

b6p9z6,travel,How to spend a week in California,"I had a holiday booked to Yosemite next Wednesday for 7 days and I got an email today saying that Halfdome Village is closed due to winter storms and my reservation is therefore cancelled.

Is it possible to do much in 7 days driving from San Francisco? I'm by myself and I'm only interested in nature rather than cities. I've thought of driving to the Grand Canyon via Death Valley and Vegas but it seems like a lot of driving (800 miles each way) with not much else to see and only 4 days to figure an itinerary and book hotels on the route.

I think I can still get £110 back for the plane ticket, not sure about the car.

And would I legally be allowed to go on a little vacation with them for the two weeks driving around to different places on the east coast in the USA? I'm not sure if I legally have to stay in the house for the majority of the time or something. I have a Canadian passport, birth certificate, citizenship, etc, as well as willing parents who will let me travel on my own. I have a low income job though I do plan on quitting it since I'll be moving to a new city in Ontario shortly after the trip."
b6iqbn,travel,"I've just missed a great deal to go to Japan, I shouldn't wait for another one, right?","&#x200B;

The deal expired on Mar 26, 2019 for Toronto > Japan for $682 which was perfect for me, with my plan aiming for flying 

in October between multi cities (Tokyo - Osaka - Seoul(Korea) - Osaka - Tokyo - Toronto)

and now the ticket prices are around $920, which I still think is much better than $1,100+. 

&#x200B;

My initial plan was to go to Korea first(I have to attend a wedding) and the fly to Japan, travel there, then fly back to 

Canada. But now that the round-trip tickets from Toronto - Tokyo are cheaper, I'm thinking to fly back and forth between

Japan and Korea.

&#x200B;

Because this is basically my first big-plan trip ever for about 2-3 weeks, I can't remove this thought of 

""But what if there's another deal!? It's like flipping $200! It's only March!""

I think it's stupid but I just have no experience.. and the only thing I can confirm is to check previous deals in the past 3-4 

years on the same site, and finding that there will probably no more deals left. And flying to Korea first doesn't seem like 

a good option anymore, I don't see any good deals in the past years.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**So here's the summary of my big concerns:**

\- What if another deal pops up? From now until whenever for my October plans? (I doubt it but can it?)

\- Making a Toronto - Tokyo round-trip seems to be the most reasonable so far, instead of flying to Korea, leave from Japan. Am I correct?

\- Is it THE time to purchase the ticket? I still have no idea how many months ahead I should purchase the tickets

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Thank you for being patient with me!!

​

So first of all: we already rented this fucking huge camper in advance, it's like 7,5 meters, so I don't know, like 24 feet. We're definitly not used to drive a car as big, so we thought about parking it outside of the cities and go there by uber or public transportation. So that we don't even need to try to fit in a small parking slot somewhere in a city which for sure will be bigger then most cities I've been to in my life. What would u sayin? Could u recommend a differnt approach?

​

Second: How expensive is a prepaid sim card with \~3GB data?

​

Third: Because of his birthday in the second week of april I was looking for music festivals, but didn't find something yet. Are there festivals we shouln't miss in april? On his birthday actually I think we could be on our way from San Diego to Joshua Tree...

​

Fourth: How difficult is it to go ""wild camping"", is it easy to find some spots where we can stay for the night without using offical campsides? (Of cause just outside of these beautiful nationalparks)

​

Fifth: If u have any tips or unusual or non-touristic places u could recommend: please feel free to open my mind :)

b6jb7h,travel,A Caribbean Island Comparison,"I've been really thinking of seeing some islands this summer and then later in the year for my birthday but I've found the problem of having no idea where to begin because they all interest me so much. The islands I'm considering are Antigua vs The Bahamas vs Curacao vs Grenada vs Guadeloupe vs Puerto Rico vs Saint Lucia.

I'm on the East coast (Georgia specifically). I'll most likely visit at least 3 this year. I've never flown before and no idea will I have flown before the trip. One of these trips will be with family and the other with friends. Meeting locals and new people is also a plus. The Bahamas interests me because of its beautiful waters and how easy it would take to get there but I feel like there might not be much to do unless I island hop which seems like that would add up considerably. I think staying on a resort for most of the trip sounds so dull. Guadeloupe seems like it would be a chance to practice my French but I don't know much about there. Curacao interests me because at first glance it doesn't seem to be a traditional Caribbean island and the IG accounts I follow who've lived there loved it. Puerto Rico seems like there would be a lot to do with the size of the island, it being a US territory and lots of english helps as well. And then I've heard tourist dollars there would really help. The other islands seem small enough that I could explore them on my own or with an excursion and that I could see most of the island in a short period.

TLDR: What are your experiences on Antigua, The Bahamas, Curacao, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Puerto Rico & Saint Lucia ? How were the people, the beaches, the water, what did you do there and how did you like it ? Also specify whether you stayed in a rental, hotel, resort, or airbnb.

b6dcve,travel,East Africa advice,"Hi all, I am likely heading to somewhere in east africa with my 72 year old dad at some point in November (he is in great shape, at least as good as me, and is a very independent traveler). We've done some crazy travel in the past through Colombia and into the Peruvian Amazon via boat and I have great memories of that, so I want to do some similar independent-type travel with him. I am also really into wildlife and would like to do some kind of safari experience. 

&#x200B;

I was doing some research today and I am totally overwhelmed. We were thinking Botswana and possibly Mozambique (he suggested it, I know it was just hit by a giant cyclone so probably not a viable option right now ...) We have about 18 days and are flying from west coast of the US. I am kind of facing sticker shock from looking at lodge prices in Botswana, many are upwards of $2k per person/per night. I know it's more of a luxury destination. I don't mind spending around $300-400 per person/night for safari but $1k plus seems crazy. Are there any countries or specific locations that offer a more budget/mid-range type of experience? I like running water and electricity so I'd prefer not to camp but I also don't need my own private plunge pool. 

For the rest of the trip, I think he'd like to rent a car and kind of adventure around. I'm now thinking maybe Tanzania and Uganda? Neither of us are super interested in S. Africa. But I'd be interested in thoughts on Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, etc.

b6lvku,travel,Travelling to Europe from Canada. Looking for a way to stay longer than 3 months. (Travel jobs and visas?),"I'm a 17 year old male living in Canada. My family and I are going on a trip to Croatia in August (I'll be 18 by then). They will come back mid-September for school and work. I plan on staying in Europe, travelling to Belgium first to stay with my good friend for 2-3 months and then exploring the rest of Europe, sometimes staying in hostels and sometimes with friends (I have friends in England and Austria, as well as possibly Italy for a week or so if I end up going down there).

I don't really have my own time limit set. I don't have plans for college yet, or a job to come back to (I'm going to be moving to a different city in Canada shortly before the vacation). Ideally I'd stay in Europe for around 6 months total. More or less. Yet I heard from my aunt who travels a lot that you can only stay within the EU for 3 months total at a time. I'm not sure if this is true or not but obviously a Visa would change that.

I'll need a job anyways so I figured why not get a couple jobs while I'm there. However, I'm not sure what I can do, or what my best options are in order to allow me flexibility to travel. There are some old threads on this but they're all years old. I feel like with all the recent EU changes it might be a good idea to ask in 2019.

As a 18 year old male Canadian with a high school diploma, some former job experience, and European family members, what could I do to stay in Europe legally? I'd prefer not to have to quit my job each time I leave a country and then job hunt in the next (especially since getting work in Croatia and Belgium is apparently extremely difficult for tourists for two differing reasons) so if there is a program that spans multiple countries that would be great. The actual plan for which countries I stay in isn't concrete yet. I'm staying in Croatia for the summer with my family; that's already planned, but besides that I don't \*need\* to go to Belgium right away after. If a certain job requires I go to a certain country, I won't mind. As long as I'm not stuck in the same country for 6 months. I'd like to get to explore western Europe as much as I can.

Note: I'm not lazy, just extremely lost. I don't know where to start. I don't want to sign up for a scam or get a shitty job when I could get a way better. That's why I'm asking for your help. I'm not afraid to do my research and don't expect everything to be handed on a platter to me.","Travelling to Europe from Canada. Looking for a way to stay longer than 3 months.

b6e2nt,travel,Looking For Advice About Menorca (Spain),"A friend and I (both 44F) will be taking a girls' holiday to Spain this July, and we want to spend a week in Menorca. We will be doing a Spanish language school in Mahon and would also like to do some snorkeling / beaching while we are there. We think we would like to stay closer to water activities and drive into Mahon for our language lessons in the mornings. I have done quite a few hours of research already but am conflicted about where the best place would be for us (all the pictures look beautiful, but internet reviews are mixed/unhelpful), so I am hoping to get some experienced input from the Reddit community. Here's what we are looking for:

1. A peaceful, quiet, small town or more rural area (but it needs to be livable, e.g., at least 1-3 places for Airbnb and food)
2. An ideal place would have places to stay within short walking distance of a place for snorkeling. We care more about the quality of the snorkeling than about a pretty beach, although having both would be cool.
3. My friend has a physical disability that allows her to easily snorkel and swim but she cannot hike distances of more than a few blocks without pain (e.g., places with 150 steps or 2 km hikes to get to the water would probably not work for her). In general our walking needs to be kept to a minimum for her to have a good vacation. Also for this reason we really don't care about proximity of tourist sites or activities other than water stuff.
4. We are looking for a quiet, restful, easygoing vacation with as few other people around as possible. We are not partiers or drinkers, aren't interested in picking up men, and don't want to be at places with huge amounts of noisy tourists, small children, dirty sand, high rises and condos, etc (part of the reason why we decided on Menorca - because it looked like a place for quiet adults to go). Given the choice, we would rather have a ""less picturesque/less interesting/less active"" place to avoid the crowds.
5. Being from the western U.S., we are completely used to and willing to drive long distances to get places (i.e., we are willing to drive to Mahon from pretty much anywhere on the island, so suggest anything!)

My research suggests that Cala Morell might fit the bill, and possibly Calo Fondo/Binnissafuller. Would you recommend either of these locations? What other cool and interesting places might I be missing?

Muchas gracias for any advice you can provide!

ON EDIT: We decided to go with Es Grau. Leaving this post up in case it might help any future travelers...","Looking For Advice About Menorca (Spain) A friend and I (both 44F) will be taking a girls' holiday to Spain this July, and we want to spend a week in Menorca. We will be doing a Spanish language school in Mahon and would also like to do some snorkeling / beaching while we are there. We think we would like to stay closer to water activities and drive into Mahon for our language lessons in the mornings. I have done quite a few hours of research already but am conflicted about where the best place would be for us (all the pictures look beautiful, but internet reviews are mixed/unhelpful), so I am hoping to get some experienced input from the Reddit community. Here's what we are looking for:

1. A peaceful, quiet, small town or more rural area (but it needs to be livable, e.g., at least 1-3 places for Airbnb and food)
2. An ideal place would have places to stay within short walking distance of a place for snorkeling. We care more about the quality of the snorkeling than about a pretty beach, although having both would be cool.
3. My friend has a physical disability that allows her to easily snorkel and swim but she cannot hike distances of more than a few blocks without pain (e.g., places with 150 steps or 2 km hikes to get to the water would probably not work for her). In general our walking needs to be kept to a minimum for her to have a good vacation. Also for this reason we really don't care about proximity of tourist sites or activities other than water stuff.

b6b9st,travel,Getting to/from Meteora in Greece -- can you help me figure out if our flights will work with the train schedules?,"Hi! We'll be going to Greece in a few months and the last piece I haven't figured out is Meteora. I found the general train routes that will get us there, but can't find the two most important parts -- time estimates for the different legs of the journey, and train schedules to make sure that there are trains we can actually make based on our already-booked flights. Maybe I'm the world's worst Googler, but it's been hours of research and I'm as confused as I was when I started. Has anyone on /r/travel made this trip before? Any advice?

Here's our flight situation:

ARRIVE -- we land in Athens at 10:10 on Friday June 7th....will there still be enough time to catch a train (or trains) to Kalambaka that same day?

DEPART -- our flight out of Athens leaves at 13:15 on Monday June 10th. I've seen whispers of 5AM trains that would get us to the Athens station at 10:30, then an hour of Metro to the airport, but I'm not sure how true that is.

We're hoping to stay in Meteora/Kalambaka all 3 nights (arrive Friday, leave super early on Monday) but I can't find train schedules to verify how long it takes to travel to/from Meteora, and whether there are trains that would work with our flight schedule.

b6dbz7,travel,"Question around Fjord Tours in Norway: Oslo to Trondheim to Bergen, or Oslo to Alesund to Geiranger to Alesund to Bergen?","Hello travel,

My fiance and I are going to be going to Norway this summer for a few days, and we're trying to figure out what kind of trip we want to take through the country.

Both of the options are serviced through [fjordtours.com](https://fjordtours.com) and take place over the same timespan.

The first would be a train from Oslo to Trondheim, and then a boat that goes from Trondheim to Bergen overnight. We were then planning on spending a few days in Bergen (and possibly a day in Trondheim as well) to do some activities.

The second option is trains and buses from Oslo to Alesund, then going from Alesund to Geiranger and spending the day there, returning Alesund and taking a boat from Alesund to Bergen.

The aspect that we're having a hard time figuring out is what we'll get to experience with either option. We were wanting to see some of the fjords while we were in Norway, and we're aware that Geiranger is a good spot for this. The thing we're having a hard time figuring out is if we're missing out big time taking the boat from Trondheim to Bergen and seeing the coast as opposed to being in Geiranger. We also know that we'll see some fjords on the route back from Bergen to Oslo.

I don't know if anyone here has done one of the tours I'm talking about above and has experience (or regret!) about the path that they ended up choosing.

I'm also curious to know if there are any smaller fjord excursions anyone would recommend in Trondheim or Bergen as well.

Does anyone know if there are any islands close to kefalonia that is architecturally similar to santorini, or have any advice on an alternative travel plan to island hop?? Thanks guys! ","Need advice in regards to island hopping in Greece! Hello everyone :)

b6aody,travel,September Honeymoon Suggestions,"Looking for suggestions/opinions/feedback on our short list for our honeymoon, currently looking at any dates after September 4th. We have really wanted to do an overwater bungalow, unfortunately those are just out of our price range with the cheapest being 13K all the way up to 20K total.

I think we have a healthy budget (10K CAD) however value is of utmost importance in our decision. While we are willing to spend the entirety of the budget, whatever is more expensive needs to offer value for the difference in cost.

Short list is as follows in no particular order:

1. Secrets Silversands (Riviera Maya) - Over the Pool Cabana: We thought this offered a good middle ground to the overwater bungalow we originally wanted.

2. Excellence Playa Mujeres (Playa Mujeres) - Two Story Suite: Have heard great things about this resort and the room looks quite luxurious and private, especially the second floor with private pool.

3. Hotel Mousai (Puerto Vallarta) - Ultra Corner Suite: Have heard good things but really not a ton of reviews compared to others. Again, really like the room and look of the resort.

4. Unico 2087 - Estancia Suite (?) (Riviera Maya): Not positive on room choice but the hesitation for this resort stemmed from the lack of reviews and the rumours of a lot of the existing reviews to be fake/sponsored. Really liked this resort for the ""Unlimited Inclusions"" as we would like to do some amount of activities.

5. El Dorado Maroma - Palafitos Bungalow (Punta Maroma): This one barely made the short list due to the cost, however if we do see that the value is there it's possible that we would take this option.

Sandals resorts really didn't sell us based on the pictures of the room when compared to the resorts on our short list and the cost just seemed like we were paying for the brand more than anything else.

b69j4z,travel,I need HELP for my 14 day Roadtrip in the USA!,"Hello everybody,

i need help for planning a road trip with my dad - because i am lost. 

It will take 14 days - visiting some relatives in the USA, Texas. 

Something like 40 miles north away from Houston, Texas - is where my relatives live. My dad suggested that the first day we just go to the relatives. And my relatives suggested we go together to San Antonio. My father already booked a car for 14 days. So it will be a road trip - he disliked my suggestions of flying to those places. 

&#x200B;

Here is a rough sketch where we want to visit: Houston; relatives place; San Antonio; Dallas; Memphis; New Orleans.

&#x200B;

Now i wonder, what's the best plan to do/ what to visit. As far as i researched on ""trip advisor"" and associated sites, the ""City Pass - Houston"" sounds good/value. Like would it make sense to get City Passes of all the major cities we are planning to visit. Like i get the Space Center is a must see etc. So the CityPass with the extras sounds ok for me. Does anyone have experience how long/time consuming the CityPass 5 places are...? like 2 or 3 days? or more less?

&#x200B;

Why those cities? -> 

Dallas: my father wants to see Basketball teams

San Antonio: trip with relatives

Memphis (Tupelo): my father wants to visit the place because of Elvis Presley 

New Orleans: a suggestion i gotten, because it's so much different from Texas. And i want to visit it.

b6c1dl,travel,Planning to travel alone to Europe for the first time and I'm scared!,"Hello, guys! How are you all doing? 

I'm kind of living a dillema and I need some help to decide what to do. 

The scenario goes like this: I'm a 24 years old Brazilian that have travelled abroad for the first time only last year (to my neighbor city Buenos Aires ♡). For this year vacations I'd like very much to visit my friend who lives in Cologne, Germany. This time, I would have to go alone because none of my friends have money or availability to go with me.
But I'm scared of it. 
Not only for the fact I'll be alone until I meet my friend where she lives but what might happen until I can get there. 
The information I have is that I don't need to get a Visa to enter the country but I have to prove what I'm going to do there, where I'm gonna stay, etc. It wouldn't be a problem because it's basically tourism, I have a permanent job here in Brazil, some savings and I'd be at my friend's house for part of the trip (I would eventually go to Berlin or Frankfurt and stay in a hotel). But what if I'm declined the entrance? I've known people who had everything right for their trip but still couldn't enter a country because immigration decided they couldn't. I mean, I understand the security issue and, of course, it's 100% correct, at the same time I'm scared that somehow I'd become part of a few percent that are denied access when the only intention is to meet somewhere new all by itself. I'd hate to create expectations about a trip, take a 11-hour flight (and connexions probably) just to be frustrated and have to return when I get there. Not even to mention the costs I would have for nothing if that happened. 
I don't know what to do. 
My vacations are in September and I need to decide as soon as possible however I cannot deny it's a possibility that will haunt me until they stamp my passport and say ""Welcome to Germany!"" (or whatever they say, I don't know). 
Does anyone have some suggestions on what should I do? I really wanna go there and live the experience still I'm afraid of everything going wrong.

b6e80l,travel,Considering Canceling Vietnam Trip and Going to South Korea in 3 Weeks Instead,"My wife and I have been planning a trip to Vietnam. We are scheduled to leave on April 14th.

&#x200B;

We initially wanted to visit South Korea because I am South Korean but haven't been there for over 20 years. 

Now we are considering canceling our flights to Vietnam and booking flights for South Korea.

&#x200B;

With this being so last minute, we have some questions...

&#x200B;

1. Should we even be considering changing our plans? We are in a rush because my grandparents are getting older by the day. If we don't go in April, we'll likely go in December. The wait is only a few months but when someone is in their 80s, tomorrow can be the last day.

&#x200B;

2) I cannot find any info about canceling flights with EVA Air. Are there fees? What if we booked using Chase Sapphire Preferred? Are there any ways to cancel without any issues?

&#x200B;

3) Anything we should be wary of for traveling on such short notice?

b665v1,travel,Morocco 10 day itinerary - looking for advise/suggestions/tips,"Hello, I am planning a 10 day trip (10 full days) with a buddy to Morocco. I've been doing some research and the route would probably look pretty standard to hit most highlights:

Day 0: Flying in to Marrakesh 

day 1: Marrakesh

day 2: Marrakesh vs. Amizamiz for hiking

day 3: travel through tizi n'tichka to skoura with stops along the way if possible

day 4: dades gorge, tondra gorge, travel to merzouga

day 5: sahara overnight

day 6: travel to fes with stops in either (ifran for hiking or meknes or volubilis)

day 7: explore Fes

day 8: chefchaouen

day 9: rabat + casablanca

day 10: spare

Day 11: Flying out of Casablanca 

&#x200B;

We're interested in a highlights tour with a mix of culture, history, food, etc. Don't really care much about beaches and relaxing.

&#x200B;

My questions are:

1. First off, is this doable in 10 days? I'm thinking of getting a car for the Marrakesh to Fes leg - but is it doable by bus?
2. Is going into Erg Chebbi through merzouga worth it? I've read fairly mixed reviews - was hoping for more recent pros/cons
3. Same for chefchaouen - looking for recent pros/cons
4. Where would you add the extra 'spare' day?
5. any other suggestions/tips/modifications are welcome!

b63c0i,travel,3 Month Central Europe/Balkans Trip Itinerary,"Hey guys, long time lurker, first time poster!

My girlfriend and I are planning a 3 month trip to Europe this July! We have a loose idea on where we want to go, but are very open to suggestions! 

We fly into Prague and will be heading south towards Slovenia, Croatian, and then the rest of the Balkans, across to Bulgaria and Romania and back up through Hungary to Prague where we fly back out. 

We love all things from vibrant cities, to quaint village towns, as well anything in nature (particularly mountains!). 

I have made a very VERY loose itenerary based on places I really want to go to, as well as a few unknowns. Because of the length of the trip I prefer staying in places a little longer than just 1 or 2 nights. 

We won't be renting cars so train and bus are our only real options to get around. (We definitely don't want to be catching flights). 

The loose itenerary looks something like this:
Prague - 4 nights;
Graz - 3 nights;
Ljubljana - 3 nights;
Zagreb - 2 nights;
Zadar - 4 nights;
Split - 3 nights;
Mostar - 3 nights;

I’ve studied in Rome a few years ago so I have good idea of what to do there for a couple days, but I’m really just looking for suggestions as far as what to do/see in some of these places. I’m a fan of cars and motorsports so I plan to visit Monza while in Milan and prior to leaving on the road trip I’ll be going to the Nurburgring. Our itinerary is flexible and I’m debating not going to Monaco if there’s not much to do there on a relatively strict budget.. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated and if you think we should swap one place for another/cancel one stop and stay an extra day elsewhere let me know! 

Thank you!!

b68yzx,travel,Where to stay in Milan,"I am traveling with a friend to northern Italy. We are staying in Milan for 2 nights and during that time are planning on seeing the historic sights Milan has to offer and going to a match at the San Siro stadium. We are not interested in shopping, but would be interested in night life. Also, the morning after our last night there we plan to make our way up to Lugano.

What would be the best area to stay in that would be most convenient for all of the above? ","Where to stay in Milan I am traveling with a friend to northern Italy.

b60gec,travel,Itinerary Help - Dolomites Day Trip From Venice,"My wife and I will be traveling to Italy in mid May and have about 3 days in Venice.  I really want to see the Dolomites for a day during this time. My plan is to rent a car and drive up. Ideally we'd like to get in a modest hike before exploring a town and driving around a bit. We are avid hikers but due to time limits would love to just get boots on the trail for even 2-3 hours. Considered doing a day tour instead of renting a car but none seem to work with doing a short hike.

As of now my plan was to arrive in Venice early on day 1, Dolomite day trip on day 2 returning back to Venice in the evening, then spending a little more time in Venice Day 3 before heading to Florence.

Alternate option could be staying overnight in the Dolomites either night 1 or night 2 but that breaks the Dolomite portion in two and cuts into Venice. Sorry for the long post. Any thoughts are very much appreciated.","Itinerary Help - Dolomites Day Trip From Venice My wife and I will be traveling to Italy in mid May and have about 3 days in Venice.

The next eclipse will be December 2020 which is summer time in Patagonia. I've always wanted to visit Patagonia so this sounds amazing, but I've never really planned an international trip before and I don't even know where to start? I've done some Google searches, and there are a lot of 10-20 day tours happening for this event but they're all more than $2000 per person (not including airfare and such).

&#x200B;

I'm imagining something that might be a couple thousand in total, but not each. I wouldn't mind camping and saving a bunch of money wherever possible, but like I said, I don't even know where to begin. Do I need to get a visa? Do I need to apply for some kind of permit to camp or hike in Patagonia? How far in advance will I need to purchase tickets/lodging?

Can anyone help me out here? Every time I try to plan a trip it just ends up never happening.","How to even get started planning a trip to Patagonia?

b619gt,travel,[Request] 9 Day trip from CA to Utah,"Hey everyone!  


Work has been exhausting and a bit overwhelming. After an upcoming project is finished my partner and I are planning a 9 day roadtrip from Cali to Utah! I was hoping to run my current itinerary (a wip) with y'all and get some feedback. Specifically, I was looking at the feasibility of my timeline, if I was missing any spots that might be on the way and were definitely worth seeing (nature spots, food places, hidden gems, rock/mineral sites).  


I know this might be a bit much to ask, but I really appreciate this community and everyone's knowledge and support.   


Here is my itinerary so far:  


1. Death Valley
2. (est 5 hrs) Zion National Park
3. (est 2 hrs) Mystic Springs (this would be used as sort of a home base to camp)
   1. (est 1 hr) Dead Horse Canyon
   2. (est 2 hr) Cedar Breaks (est 2 hrs back to Mystic Springs)
4. (est 2 hrs) Bryce Canyon
5. (est 30 min) Grand Staircase
6. (est 1 hr) Zebra Canyon
7. (est 1 hr) Capitol Reef
8. (est 1 hr) Goblin Valley
9. (est 2 hr) Canyonlands
10. (est 30 min) Arches 
11. (est 2 hrs) Gooseneck Can
12. (est 6 hrs) Dinosaur Monument
13. (est 2 hr) Unitas Mountains
14. (est 4 hrs) Salt Lake City (hopefully an area to rockhound for Agates or Jaspers)
15. (est 2 hrs) Antelope Island

  
With this in mind, I have not taken account of sleeping, eateries, and a great deal of camping spots on the way. I am not rigid in keeping to the script, so if this is unrealistic for 9 days or if you feel as if some of these places should be replaced with different spots I am interested! If y'all have any advice or feedback it would be super helpful.   


Appreciate you all!

I'm a little concerned since it will be at night and I don't know where my accommodation is and I'm a female traveling alone. So safety is my main priority.

&#x200B;

I don't want a packed day. I just want to wake up early, go to the park in front of the Eiffel tower, do a little reading, have some french pastries and head to the airport. (if possible I'd love to go to the macaron store in front of the opera and get some macarons. I remember they were heavenlyyyy.)

&#x200B;

Do you that will be doable? I think I should start heading to the airport at noon. Can I relax that time more or should I start heading to the airport earlier? I will only have a carry on.

b5zee4,travel,Morocco: Advice on Merzouga dessert trip vs Atlas mountains day trip,"Hello all! My girlfriend and I are heading to Morocco in a few months and are trying to nail down our itinerary. We would really like to visit Merzouga, as well as the Atlas mountains, and we are having trouble fitting everything into our 7 day schedule. We thought we might save a bit of time if we did one of the 3 day 2 night tours to Merzouga which takes you through the Atlas mountains. We've done some research and it looks like all of these tours basically take you through the Atlas mountains stopping in Dades for the night, then on to Merzouga the next day. Has anyone done one of these tours, and if so, do you feel like you got enough of an experience of the Atlas mountains in particular? Or would we be better off doing a separate Atlas mountains tour, if this is a much more valuable experience? Any insight is really appreciated.

b5sfxs,travel,2 weeks in Georgia (Europe): Looking for advice concerning my itinerary,"Hello everyone,

&#x200B;

so I will be spending two weeks in Georgia with my girlfriend this upcoming August. I would greatly appreciate it if you could give me some advice on my itinerary. Is there anything you would do differently? Something that I missed out on? Of course I did my research (reddit, caucasus-trekking etc.) but there might still be something that I missed. Thank you in advance!

As you will see, we like hiking and exploring nature with a bit of city exploring, too. Since we're going in August, is it possible to bathe in a lake somewhere along our way? Any recommendations?

Here's what I've planned so far:

&#x200B;

* **Day 1:** Arrive at Kopitnari Airport. Transfer to Kutaissi and spend the rest of the day there as well as the night.
* **Day 2:** Marshrutka to Mestia
* **Day 3 + 4 + 5 + 6:** Hike from Mestia to Ushguli
* **Day 7:** Day hike from Ushguli to Chvelpi through Latpari pass
* **Day 8:** Marshrutka to Zugdidi. Spend the day there --> Night train to Tbilisi
* **Day 9 + 10:** Explore Tbilisi 
* **Day 11 + 12 + 13:** Hire a guide/driver with a 4WD to get us to Kazbegi. Do some more hiking there
* **Day 14:** Marshrutka to Tbilisi. Spend the rest of the day and the night there
* **Day 15:** Catch the flight back home","2 weeks in Georgia (Europe): Looking for advice concerning my itinerary Hello everyone,

b5wt9q,travel,2 Weeks in Spain & Portugal--Would love some advice,"I'm fairly new to travelling and this will be my first solo trip that's more than a few days so I'm a little nervous and overwhelmed from researching and would really appreciate some advice. I'm flying from Edinburgh. The timing is flexible (I can extend to 3 weeks) and I haven't booked anything yet. The original plan was Porto--> Lisbon-->Seville-->Madrid-->Barcelona. I'm now thinking that this would be a bad idea as it would result in me being in Barcelona around Easter which I'm worried would be far too crowded for my liking (I know wherever I am on Easter will probably be crowded but I imagine less so than Barcelona)

Current tentative plan is:

 

April 10 Barcelona

April 11 Barcelona

April 12 Barcelona

April 13 Barcelona

April 14 Early bus/train from Barcelona--Madrid

April 15 Madrid

April 16 Madrid--day trip to Toledo

April 17 Madrid--Porto

April 18 Porto

April 19-Porto-Lisbon

April 20 Lisbon

April 21 Lisbon-day trip to Sintra

April 22 Lisbon--Seville (I don't know if this is a good idea on Easter Monday)

April 23 Seville 

April 24 Seville-- ....

And then maybe a day or two in Granada and/or Cordoba 

I'm also considering visiting Ronda and then flying out of Malaga

Barcelona is the cheapest to fly in and out of but I imagine that the cost of getting back to Barcelona would outweigh the difference

Seville and Malaga are both around 30-40 pounds cheaper to fly out of then Porto or Lisbon so that's why it's ordered that way. Is it dumb to go in and out of Spain? Would it make more sense to do Barcelona--> Madrid-->Seville (+ other places in Andalucia) and then Lisbon --> Portugal and fly out of Portugal? The flight out of Porto is around double the price of flying out of Malaga or Seville

I'm mildly interested in seeing an Easter procession (I know these are best in Seville) but would like to avoid crazy crowds. 

The only places in the itinerary that are must-sees for me are Barcelona, Porto, and Lisbon--the rest I am flexible on. I am debating scrapping Madrid entirely as my understanding is that it is mainly museums and those don't really appeal to me. I am, however, a young solo traveler who is interested in the nightlife + I know I would enjoy Toledo so it's still on the itinerary. 

Also--any recommendations for fun, social hostels in any of these locations. I'm new to travelling on my own and would like to meet people.

Would take any advice/recommendations that y'all could give me. I am mainly interested in beautiful architecture, wandering around old areas, and experiencing the culture. Museums and most paid tourist attractions don't really appeal to me (although I will pay to see Gaudi's work in Barcelona as that looks amazing) I tend to walk 30km a day while travelling and my style is to just walk in the direction of the prettiest building I see and wander from there. I also would like to meet people and enjoy the nightlife. My expenses are flexible but cheaper is better and I'm okay with long bus rides if that means saving money.

Anyway, thoughts on any of these things would be much appreciated. I'm feeling a tad overwhelmed planning on my own but am really excited to explore more of the world!

- Visit Khaosan Road  
- Visit/go to the top of King Power MahaNakhon  
- Visit Lumphini Park  
- Partake in a River Dinner Cruise

- Island hop  
- Visit Ko Phi Phi  
- Visit Railey  
- Visit the Emerald Pool  
- Snorkeling    
- Day trip to Khao Sok national park (I know this is probably unrealistic or impossible but would absolutely love to visit here)  

**Chiang Mai**

- Day trip to Doi Ithanon national park, see the king and queens pagodas  
- Thai cooking class   
- Day trip to Pai   
- Visit some of the mountain temples such as Wat Phra That Doi Kham    

Some other things we want to do that aren't tied to a specific location:

- Ziplining  
- Kayaking  
- Some short/mild hiking or trekking  
- See some cool waterfalls

b5qkmy,travel,"First international travel, looking forward to everything but the flight","COS: USA Six months out from travel.

Going to be 40 this year, and have been dreaming about this trip for over 20 years. Finally applied for my passport, and we have flats picked out in London and Paris. We know what we want to do, so no, AutoModerator, we aren't looking for advice for London or Paris.

My hangup is the flight.

I haven't flown much in my life, less than ten total flights. I have a bit of a height issue (I wouldn't call it fear), and I don't like not being in control. The safety record is well known to me, but still it persists. There's two areas that I could use some advice/feedback on.

**Comfort:** It takes a perfect scenario for me to get to sleep. I am a stomach sleeper, as much as I've tried to change that. I doubt I will be getting much sleep sitting up in a cramped seat, but I am trying out ANC headphones, pillows, etc now to see what might assist. I am of average height, so legroom isn't a huge deal. I'm not thin, but I also don't come close to overflowing  the confines of my seat. The more I can't fall asleep, the more anxious I get about falling asleep and it cascades. All the flights from Atlanta to London are overnight, which works for our itinerary, but I'm worried I will be a mess trying to function even until dinner time. The only other overnight flight I've taken was from SFO-ATL, and I slept perhaps thirty minutes. It wasn't very fun.

**Cost:**The above dovetails into price. I can find RT tix ATL-LHR for about $650 ($1300 for both of us) in lowest level economy via a third party off Skyscanner. Now, I've seen plenty of advice that says to book with the airline, but that bumps it up to $890pp. I could then upgrade off that if I care to. Premium Economy is running roughly double my original $650pp ticket. Is some more legroom worth double? Is being able to select your seat worth $110? We're hoping to travel light, just a carry on bag for us each.

I just have no frame of reference to know if the $650pp deal is good, to not buy third party, and if it's worth double to change from Economy Basic to Premium Economy (the carrier I am basing all this off of is BA, but it seems to be the same for Delta, et al). Since we've never really traveled, we have no loyalty, points, or anything other than currency to use. We hope this is the beginning of the second half of our lives traveling more, but we are starting basically from scratch. In a similar manner, I have no idea which airlines and which planes are better than others, only that a ton of people are not impressed with United.

- Mediterranean beaches
- Great scenery/hiking
- water related activities (scuba/snorkeling, jet skis, parasailing, etc.)

- eating seafood and pasta (maybe cooking classes?)
- Mediterranean beaches
- Great scenery/hiking
- water related activities (scuba/snorkeling, jet skis, parasailing, etc.)

We’re both 28 and in relatively good shape so feel free to recommend any physically demanding activities too.

We were thinking about Airbnb’s and maybe a hotel on a night or two, so any accommodation recommendations would be useful as well!

b5og5o,travel,US tourist Visa to attend a test prep course rejected (sudan),"I'm a 22 year old medical graduate, graduated on December 13 last year (2018) and have a free period of 7 month before I start my medical foundation year in my country (sudan)
So I decided on taking adavnstage of this period of free time to prep for a master degree in us or Canada. I applied for a tourist Visa to the US in order to attend kaplan's GRE prep course in Brooklyn newyork (for a month period) , that I have already payed for and got the enrollment letter and receipt, also I will attend another course in marrocco Casablanca in July 2019, after the gre course, which I also have enrollment letter from... I had all my papers ready enrollment letters, and certificate proving I have medical foundation year and civil service program due at the end of 2019. Yet I got my Visa rejected after only 4 questions, noting that my cousin who is a us citizen payed for my course, and the expenses of the trip will be payed by my family, which I got bank statement proving so. I haven't even got the opportunity to show my documents and only got asked what is the cause of visit and whom will be paying for my trip.
My question...why did my Visa get rejected without the consulate officer reviewing all the documents that will prove I will be returning to Sudan?, and also am planning on applying again for a second time immediately to catch the course that I already payed for...should I apply again? And what advise you can offer?

b5w57o,travel,"Messed over by horribly delayed visas, travel insurance denied, any way for refund/credits?","I'm not the one directly effected but i'm posting on their behalf:

Some friends of mine in college (they're kenyan nationals studying in the usa, i'm an american born citizen) planned a decent ahead for a trip to paris/barcelona during spring break (march 25th to 29th for them) and got all their ducks in a row, mostly importantly **they started the visa application process for france very early** (14 days before the flight, when the visa people themselves said they only need ""at least"" 5 days). In particular the visa agent completely failed to request any kind of health insurance information initially, didn't mention it, then several days later came back saying it was required, which delayed the process by a lot.

&#x200B;

**The flight was supposed to be YESTERDAY and the visas STILL have not arrived**, and my friends can't even get any worthwhile information on when they'll get their passports back, they're being held hostage. So they essentially cannot leave the country.

&#x200B;

So, me thinking ahead while booking tickets before all this visa situation happened, i saw an ad for **trip mate travel insurance**, thinking it was comprehensive since on the website where we bought the tickets stated ""covers cancellation for any reason"", turns out any reason is pretty rare circumstances such as serious injury or a terrorist attack. Trip mate has a long list of people with very legitimate claims being denied for various bullshit reasons. Visas being held hostage isn't even considered claimable. Student universe just directs them to trip mate so they're not useful

&#x200B;

**is there any avenue by which they can plead to someone's humanity to get some (let alone all) of their money back? Even flight credits?** Like, should they contact the airline directly? Try to talk to a higher up at trip mate? Insist on student universe? They were saving up for many months for this trip, but now they're out a trip and out $466 per person because of some shitty visa processing.

It really seems like travel insurance is a complete scam and focusing on refundable tickets is a much better use of money

b5s3um,travel,Westjet help! Nightmare vacation,"Hi (I’m posting for my in laws),
They booked a westjet vacation via a travel agent. They asked for it to be a 4 star, all inclusive, and in the beach of Puerto Vallarta. As they have never been to PV, they relied on the expertise of the agent booking the vacation. They ended up at the Krystal resort. Apparently, it was not only old and dilapidated but dirty and disgusting. There was garbage on the beach, exposed wiring throughout the resort, and staff that seemed unwilling or unable to address their concerns (of which there were many). Some other examples of issues: The pools were unlit and scummy, there were dirty dishes in the hallway that were never taken away, they didn’t have hot water in the room until day 3, which sporadically seemed to fix itself, the only clean water that was provided were two small water bottles in the otherwise empty room fridge.

Now, I have to state that my in-laws are genuinely nice people that will make the best out of any situation. However, when feeling unsafe and unheard, it is understandable that they feel as though their trip should be refunded in some way. 

So, they have contacted the travel agent and Westjet. They both insist this resort was 4 star, and therefore it is not their fault there were issues. Westjet offered $400 compensation to be used on another vacation. On a $4000 trip, that seems like a slap in the face. 

My question is: has anyone has this experience with Westjet and if so how can they get a full refund, or at least better compensation to feel as though the trip wasn’t completely wasted.","Westjet help! Nightmare vacation Hi (I’m posting for my in laws),

b5os10,travel,Worried this apartment I booked might be a scam,"I recently booked a trip to Amsterdam for May.

For accomadation I booked an apartment in the city centre via booking.com. The price was about £1,100 Euro for the 4 nights and I paid via credit card. This was a no cancellations allowed booking.

Soon after booking I was messaged by the host via booking.coms messaging system, giving me the exact address and asking to arrange a check in time. The message also mentioned that I could pay the €500 damage deposit in cash deposit to the person who checks me in.

Wtf... I never agreed to this deposit I thought.

I scoured the apartments listing on the website, and finally, right down the bottom of the page, far far below the button I actually clicked to book (about 4 screen worths down) I see mention of a damage deposit.

I’ve occasionally booked places that have a deposit before via Airbnb, but in that case the website handles that, and will take the deposit amount from you if you trashed the place. I’d have no problem with this if booking.com handled the deposit and I could pay via credit card (where I’m somewhat protected). Handing over €500 cash seems like a good way to get scammed though. Never done it before. I don’t even really want to withdraw that much from the bank, just to have to convert it and then put it back in the bank later. Also even if legit and they’re late for some reason to check us out and we have to go for our flight, we wouldn’t get it back as it’s done via cash.

What do people think, this sounds very fishy to me.","Worried this apartment I booked might be a scam I recently booked a trip to Amsterdam for May.

b5k3k5,travel,"Opera singer/researcher with a midrange budget, solo traveling to Italy, Berlin, and more.","Hello /r/travel! I'm seeking a bit of advice regarding a large solo trip I'm planning on taking this summer.

Some preface. I'm a professional opera singer and lover of classical music just graduating from conservatory. I'm 21, male, I have an American passport, am 21 years old, and speak English and conversational Italian. 


June 10th - July 20th: I will be residing in [Novafeltria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novafeltria), Italy, a tiny town with a population of around 7,500 people. I am there on account of an American pre-professional program, where I'll perform in 2 fully staged operas. Room and Board are all paid for, and I have weekends off to explore. I will be taking 15 hours of Italian per week (included in the program) and I plan to spend a week and a half in Italy before traveling to my next location.

Additionally, I am in the process of securing a $3,500 (EU 3100) Research grant to build on my studies in Italy. After I am finished performing there, I plan to travel up Italy and eventually end up in Berlin, where the rest of my research will take place.

My tentative itinerary is as plan as such is as follows. (All travel most likely be by rail, and I will be staying in hostels)

July 21st. Bus to ROME
July 27th. Rail to FLORENCE
July 31st - Rail to BERLIN. Arrive morning of August 1st.

For the rest of my summer, my time will spent in Berlin. The only requirement is that I spend 40 hours a week involved in independent research, which centers upon German operetta/cabaret from the 1900's-1930's

QUESTIONS!

Is there anywhere you all recommend going besides Florence and Rome? what are some of the undiscovered gems of central Italy? Novafeltria is also close to Bologna and San Marino as well, and I was wondering if there's anywhere better to spend my time than the big tourist destinations

I have never travelled solo before. I have been to the UK, Scotland, Belize, Puerto Rico, and Costa Rica before, but they were all with friends, family, or school. What has your experience been with solo travel in Germany and Italy?

I essentially plan to stay in Berlin until my EU 3100 runs out. Do you think Berlin would be the best city in which to stay? Berlin was my first choice, But I considered Paris, Barcelona, Munich, Vienna, Krakow, and Zürich as well for their musical history around the turn of the century.

Is backpacking a thing in Germany? Johann Sebastian Bach is my absolute favorite musician, and I would love to recreate the [250 mile journey](https://bachtrack.com/feature-at-home-guide-bach-buxtehude-lubeck-arnstadt-august-2017) he took from Arnstadt to Lübeck when he was 20!

* 1. Land in Phnom Penh, spend 2 days(?) there to visit the museums. Is this enough time? I hear you don’t need to spend much time here. 



* 2. Head to Siem Reap (by plane? By bus? Which is better for the experience?/safety)



* 3. Spend 5? Days there and visit the temples / pub street / markets



* 4. Head to batambang for a day or so? I figure there’s a way to get there from siem reap and it can be a 1 day trip. 




* 5. This is where I kinda get muddled. We want to also go to tropical areas like beaches, so I was thinking Koh Rong? If so how many days would be good? Any other islands / beach relaxing areas you guys would recommend?




I feel like even after this we have plenty of days left. Planning on maybe flying to Chiang Mai for like 3 days as well.

I have a feeling these are going to be very niche questions, but I had a few questions about travel in Kazakhstan.

1. The website Carvanistan mentioned the possibility to drive an old Zhiguly - does anyone know anything about this?
2. For anyone who's been to the Arasan spa in Almaty, is it possible to get a private room for just a small family?
3. In Ile-Alatau Park south of Almaty, is anyone familiar with the Tuyuk-Su Gates Hotel (Отель Ворота Туюк-Су)? The one that's a bit south of the Shymbulak ski resort. I've only been able to find Russian-language sources about it, and it appears to have no website.

I know these are hyper-specific, so I totally understand if no one has any info about these. Thanks.","Specific Questions About Travel in Kazakhstan Hi everyone,

b5g9km,travel,Where to go for mountain views?,"Looking to take a trip with a friend, but have little experience with traveling. We would like to stay within the US or Canada.

We've been suggested Colorado, Banff, and Anchorage.

We're trying to find somewhere that we can choose to sit at the hotel and take in the views, or take a short trip to town and do some activities (beer tours, museums, etc)

Anyone have any recommendations on a destination that may fit our criteria?

Thanks

b5g2pj,travel,Paris + Lyon OR Brussels... 6 days to split between them,"My SO and I will be in Reims, France in June for the Women's World Cup. We're flying out of Paris afterwards, but haven't decided where to fly into. We have 6 days to travel before we have to be in Reims. Of course, we want to spend time in Paris. So we're trying to decide if we should spend all 6 days in Paris, or potentially spend 2-3 days in either Lyon or Brussels. We would fly into one of the other cities and then take a train to Paris. Is 3-4 days enough for Paris? And on the other hand, would 2-3 days be sufficient for Brussels or Lyon? Is one ""better"" than the other, for how we like to travel?

Travel preferences: We both appreciate museums, but honestly can't do more than 1 or 2 museums before we're ""museumed out"", so we'll probably save our museum time for Paris. We prefer wandering around to see the city, eating and drinking local beverages (specifically local beer or wine), people watching, etc. 

If anyone has suggestions or stories to offer up, we'd greatly appreciate it.

My girlfriend and I have been planning a trip to Spain from the US for a little while now. Our lodging has been booked and we are all set to spend 11 days there in May.

Our basic itinerary has already been mapped out, we're flying into Madrid for the first leg of the trip, then planning on taking the train down to Granada for just two days, then to Ronda for the remainder until we return to Madrid for our flight home.

I would like to be able to book our train tickets ahead of time so we don't have to worry about anything. But I seem to be running into some trouble.

I was able to book tickets for our initial ride from Madrid to Granada on May 21 without issue from the Renfe website.

However, I was not able to book tickets from Granada to Ronda for May 22, or our final tickets from Ronda back to Madrid on May 26.

Renfe's website says they're unavailable, and I also couldn't find them on places like Loco2 or Eurorail.

I plan to keep checking, but is it normal for them not to be available at this time? When is the best time to buy them? And if I'm unable to get them in time, can anyone tell me what I can expect trying to buy them on the day of?

b5glmq,travel,Cyclades Honeymoon Tips?,"My fiancé and I are 95% sure we want to have our honeymoon in the Cyclades in July. At first we wanted to stay on Mykonos, but one of my friends told me that it is a crazy island and people will be loud and drunk. 

We do want to have fun and maybe party a little, but I think we are mostly looking for a chill time laying on nice sandy beaches while sipping on drinks, looking at great scenery. Santorini was first on our minds, but the beaches are very rocky from the looks of it, so I don’t know how much we’d enjoy that. It’s also most likely going to be insanely crowded and expensive in July. We’d still like to see those sights, but not the whole time we’re there, which will be about 2 weeks. 

I’ve been looking at Naxos and Paros, and they seem to have more cost effective resorts with beautiful views. I have a feeling they are a bit more under appreciated as well compared to the better known islands.

We do also want to make time to visit the other islands if possible, and it looks like those two islands are between the most popular ones.

I guess my question is does anyone have any good tips on what islands or resorts we should stay at to get a bit of privacy, relax, but also be able to get out and do fun things, in peak season? Or a 2 week itinerary for people who want to mostly chill, but still have a bit of adventure?","Cyclades Honeymoon Tips?

Should i take the high road through Bolivia, hitting Uyuni, La Paz and Lake Titicaca, or take the low road through Chile and visit San Pedro de Atacama and Iquique?

I like the idea of the beach, but the cost of Bolivia over Chile definitely has an appeal, and i feel maybe Chile is too westernised? Who knows?","Chile or Bolivia? So first some context:

Flying into Amsterdam and out of Prague of course.

We have 5 nights between Amsterdam and Brutal Assault to fill. I was thinking of spending those in Ghent, and taking day trips to Bruges, Antwerp, and Brussels. However, I'm starting to wonder if maybe we should go to Germany instead. Belgium looks kind of...slow I guess you could say? I'd personally find it awesome I think, but I'm wondering if Germany might be a better choice for a group of guys who kind of just want to party and wander around and shoot the shit. I've been to Bavaria once before and it was pretty much the most fun I've ever had. Belgium seems extremely urban with little to no nature at all. I wonder if we will already have our fill of such thing in Amsterdam/Utrecht. Maybe we should go to Cologne and Stuttgart with those 6 days instead so we could explore some castles/ruins/whatever in the countryside?

b5d158,travel,First time flyer and going big to Ireland. But I have questions.,"Hello fellow redditors of r/travel!
So as the title says, I’m a first time flyer and I’m planning a trip to Ireland from the U.S.
I have a lot of questions and most of them can be answered by a simple google search, however, there is one question that I’m hung up on and can’t seem to get past or even get answered.

With Brexit being the total mess that it is and personal situations, booking a flight is becoming a challenge. I’ve got my time frame worked out (End of May, so almost 2 months out) but most flights I see that fit the time frame I need, and price, still show the Boeing 737 MAX-8 as Interstate flights to larger airports (I’m coming from Tulsa, Oklahoma). And just about every single one is non-refundable unless it’s within 24 hours.
So being that I’ve never flown anywhere or had to deal with airlines, I have no idea how cancellations work. 
If something happens and I decide (not the airline) that situations become unsafe and that I don’t want to put my family in any danger or my personal situations don’t allow me to travel, is there any way to cancel or would I just be out all of the money that I would spend on the tickets and the airline would just sell someone else the tickets? Or could I cancel within 7 days or something and be refunded at least partially? If I didn’t state anything clear enough I’d be happy to discuss and clarify anything that needs cleared up.

TL;DR - I guess I don’t understand cancellation policies. I’m planning a trip 2 months out but don’t want to spend $3,000+ dollars on airline tickets I can’t use if I’m unable to go. Is a cancellation and refund possible after 24 hours without death?

Edit: So I’ve realized that I’m overlooking and overthinking what’s black and white. I’ve got a combination of first time traveling abroad jitters, first time flying jitters all in one (which is no excuse) and basically I’m overthinking everything. I just need to stick to my window and go. 
I appreciate all of the feedback that was given.

My partner and I are traveling to Scotland mid May as the title states.

We’ve decided to start in Edinburgh, spend a few days there (I’ve heard even a week there isn’t enough), and then rent a camper van traveling north and then back down south to Glasgow or Edinburgh over the course of a week give or take a couple days.

Basically I’m wondering if anyone has had good/bad experiences with different camper van rental companies including prices etc.

I have had a couple quotes from different companies ranging from $500 - $800/week depending on the features/space of the vehicle.

On top of that, if anyone has any ‘you absolutely cannot miss ________’ places I’m all ears. It may already be on the route!

b5fvoi,travel,Going for a Second Trip to Japan(With Friends this time) Looking to make it even better than the first trip,"I first went to Japan in the early Summer of 2013, and I have been itching to go back ever since. Now I finally have the means to make the trip a reality in the near future, and at least two friends who want to go as well to help share the costs.

My first trip was 3 weeks and i ended up staying in Narita, because it was 900$ including a free breakfast each day and i couldn't pass up the savings, but after a while the commute via shuttling back to the airport and taking the airport bullet train into downtown tokyo was taxing, wasting up to 2 hrs each day of exploring time and forcing me back before 6pm or being stranded from my hotel. It was a good exploratory trip but i definitely missed a lot, and want to correct that the next time around.

I am very much a ""home baser"" when it comes to traveling. I need a safe, secure and above all else \*private\* place to be able to return to, but this time I want to see how having that home base in Tokyo would work out time and cost wise. I've always considered Sakura Hotel as the best option as recommended by other traveling friends, but with the rising popularity of AirBnB, i was wondering if people had good experience using it in Japan. As long as it isn't a group hostel, I'd be comfortable with most room types, such as apartment or a whole private house, as long as it was somewhat central.

After lodging, when to go is the next concern. The friends who want to go with me are really insistent in going to Comiket, which has us in either August or late December. I am not a fan of summer traveling(Because greater than 30C is no bueno for me) so It looks like they are set on December barring me convincing them to forgo Comiket for something else. I'm wondering what kinds of festivals or unique events happen in late December Early January in Japan that might be good to see, or other ""Must See'' events that happen more in the fall or spring that might convince them to consider over Comiket. We are all big foodies, so big food related events would be an easy sell, or events that have really interesting seasonal fare. Anything with food, really.

Any tips or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.","Going for a Second Trip to Japan(With Friends this time) Looking to make it even better than the first trip I first went to Japan in the early Summer of 2013, and I have been itching to go back ever since.

b5cf40,travel,Planning a surprise trip to Chicago for BF- recommendations/advice please!,"(19/F)

Hey guys. My BF's birthday is in July, but since his favorite band is playing in Chicago in May, I've decided to plan a trip to Chicago for him as an early birthday present. We're from the Detroit area, so we're probably just going to drive to save cash. I've been to Chicago but only once and on a school trip (I don't leave the state much) so I'm not familiar at all with the area, how parking works, must-see attractions/places, etc. Here are just a few of my questions:

1. How much is a reasonable amount for parking? Here we're used to around a $10 flat rate at the most, but I'm sure in Chicago it's much more expensive. I've done a little bit of Chicago research and seen $18/day flat rates, as well as $30/day flat rates. What's reasonable, and what's too much?
2. How much is a reasonable amount for hotel/lodging? I found a hotel (W Chicago Lakeshore?) on a list of ""best Chicago hotels on a budget"" and for two nights it looks like it would be around $290 or so per person. It's a really nice looking hotel, some of the rooms have a beautiful view of Lake Michigan, and it's less than 15 minutes away from where the band is playing. Is this too much for a hotel in Chicago, or is it a good amount considering the quality/convenience? (Context: we're two college students who aren't broke by any means but we can't spend $400-$500 per night on a hotel) 
3. Since we'll be going in May, what are the best things to do considering the weather/season? Any must-go/must-see places? Restaurants/food places we absolutely must eat at? BF and I love going places with nice scenery, like flowers or gardens. Any cool art or science museums? Bookstores? We're big gamers, are there any arcades or anything like that?
4. Aside from hotel fees, what is a good budget for the weekend? We'd probably get there Friday afternoon or so and leave Sunday. Since I don't know how much more expensive food/services is in Chicago, I'm really not quite sure where to start. 

Sorry for all the questions; I'm a huge planner so I really want to be sure I've got this all figured out. If anyone has any advice or recommendations, please let me know!!","Planning a surprise trip to Chicago for BF- recommendations/advice please! (19/F)

My family and I (parents in 50s, kids in late teens/twenties) are heading to Norway in July and have 3 days to spend in between Stavanger and Bergen. I know this is a pretty short amount of time so I’d love to get feedback on our itinerary! For context, we're pretty active/outdoorsy and are used to driving long stretches of road (in the United States, we've driven from New York to Florida 4 times, once from New York to New Orleans, we've done tons of vacations centered around driving long distances + hiking) but I am recovering from a hip injury so we may have to be a bit less intense than usual.

Here is [a google map](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dujJf5O5sWXXaHJP-CMIbM_jtm77Zr6A&usp=sharing) that I've used to plot out some points for our planned route. I know right now 520 is closed between Hellandsbygd and Hara so the map is telling us to take a huge detour through points C and D, but in the summer we can drive that way directly. 

**Day 1:**

* Arrive in Stavanger early morning, by overnight train from Oslo
* Pick up rental car
* Drive to + hike Pulpit Rock (done by 3:00 PM/15:00?)
* Drive north, stopping by waterfalls along the way (e.g. Svandalsfossen, Latefossen)
* Stay in Odda

**Day 2:**

* Drive to Fonna Ski Glacier Resort, do glacier hike with Folgefonni Breførarlag (done by 4:30 PM/16:30)
* Continue north and east, drive towards Mabodalen Valley, Hardangervidda
* Stay anywhere near/between Kinsarvik and Eidfjord (or east of that)

**Day 3:** 

* Drive towards Bergen
* If time permits, hang out in Bergen
* Flight out of Bergen around 10:00 PM/22:00

**Questions:**

1. Overall, is this itinerary doable? We're hoping to take advantage of the long stretches of daylight in July to start as early as possible in the mornings and/or drive late into evenings, but I know this might seem ambitious.
2. General tips for driving in Norway? Multiple people in our family are comfortable driving through mountain roads/at night, but we've only driven in the U.S. so we don't know if there's anything particular to look out for in Norway.
3. How long do we need to spend at stops along the route, for example at the waterfalls? It seems like these waterfalls are pretty accessible and don't need a lot of hiking/time, but I'm not sure.
4. Has anyone done a glacier hike with Folgefonni Breførarlag? How was your experience? Was it worth the money? Are there options do slightly easier routes, in case my hip isn't feeling too well?
5. Are there other hiking options around day 2 or day 3 of this route that are moderate? (e.g. I don't think we have time for Trolltunga, so something shorter/easier than that would be great!)
6. If we have maybe 2-3 hours in Bergen, what would you suggest we do? We'll have our rental car, and are open to anything more outdoorsy, or also anything more in the city. We want to be at BGO by or before 8:00 PM/20:00.

3. How long do we need to spend at stops along the route, for example at the waterfalls? It seems like these waterfalls are pretty accessible and don't need a lot of hiking/time, but I'm not sure.
4. Has anyone done a glacier hike with Folgefonni Breførarlag? How was your experience? Was it worth the money? Are there options do slightly easier routes, in case my hip isn't feeling too well?
5. Are there other hiking options around day 2 or day 3 of this route that are moderate? (e.g. I don't think we have time for Trolltunga, so something shorter/easier than that would be great!)
6. If we have maybe 2-3 hours in Bergen, what would you suggest we do? We'll have our rental car, and are open to anything more outdoorsy, or also anything more in the city. We want to be at BGO by or before 8:00 PM/20:00.

Thanks a ton in advance!!"
b5elb7,travel,Expedited US Passport *actual* timeline?,"I need a replacement US passport for a trip in 22 days. 

The expedited passport timeline says 2-3 weeks. Is that really a reasonable expectation?  My international flight is 6am 3 weeks from tomorrow.  Can I expect that my new one will arrive in time if I expedite it?

I’m not eligible to make an appointment at an agency for the super-fast service until within 2 weeks of travel. I’m at the post office now (my local passport acceptance facility), and I’d rather not wait another week for an appointment and have to kill another whole morning sitting at a place if I can help it.

Do you think this is too dangerous to send it through the mail (in person) today and hope that my new passport arrives no later than Monday, 3/15 - which would honestly scare the hell out of me if it didn’t get here sooner?  Or is that playing with fire and I really need to just schedule an appointment for April 3rd at the New York Passport Agency and bring my proof of travel?

What have your *actual* timelines been recently for receiving an expedited passport thru USPS?  I’m only seeing posts on here from a number of years ago...

b57k6v,travel,Has anyone else felt as though travelling has lost its spark?,"Hey, y'all.

I've traveled quite a bit. Maybe 15-20 countries. I've lived abroad in a couple as well. 

I've just started another trip that will last me a couple months (South Korea right now), and I'm just not feeling the spark like I normally do.  I've gone out and walked around quite a bit since I've been here. Drank at a few bars and met some really cool people that I had a great connection with. I've eaten some good food and seen some sights. All and all, it sounds pretty good, but in reality I don't have that feeling of freedom and pure joy that I've come to expect with travel. I haven't felt anything at all really since I bought the ticket. To be fair, I'm dealing with a bout of depression at the moment and I was hoping the travelling would help with that. 

I find myself wanting to go back to the countries I've already been or lived in because I have a sense of nostalgia for them, and I want to feel the comfort of a second home. But, really deep down that's not travelling anymore and I've done that before a few times and been disappointed because I return home without seeing something new or expanding my perspective.

b559on,travel,Chances of rejection for my Spanish student Visa?,"I'm afraid this'll be a bit of a story and a lot of explaining to do, so I appreciate anyone who takes the time to thoroughly read this!

I am a 19-year old Venezuelan girl going through the cumbersome process of obtaining a long-term visa to study in a Spanish university. So far, the bureaucracy has been painful but manageable. I graduated from an American school, but I am currently living with my aunt and uncle in Venezuela, as my family (both of my parents and younger brother) are currently living in the United States. Of course, I can only apply for the visa in my country of birth, so I'm doing all the paperwork and process practically alone, from Venezuela. 

Even though it's a bit of a burden with all the political issues we have going on here, it has not been impossible. 

... But. 


I have one issue going on that has made me lose quite a few hours of sleep. I don't know if this might result in the waste of all of my effort, time, and money in the past few months. I'm scared. Here goes the story:


Almost two years ago, in 2017, I graduated from high school and had to take an unsolicited, unchosen, basically obligatory gap year. I wanted to go to university right away, and was even accepted to a hard-to-get-into university in Venezuela. However, we all then realised that since I did not hold a Venezuelan diploma (as mine is American), I was not allowed to actually attend the university. I had to do a ""legalisation"" of my diploma which would take 2 (two) years. I was devastated, since I was really looking forward to studying there, I'm a good student, and I worked very hard to get the grades I got. I couldn't study in America either because it is way too expensive. At that time, we could not even afford to pay the SAT, let alone American university applications. 


So after graduating and not being able to study, I was recommended that being an Au Pair might be a nice idea while I waited out the 2-year time. So without anything else in mind, that's what I did. I did my research and found a seemingly nice family in Poland from an Au Pair website who wanted me to be their Au Pair for at least 8 months. I thought that it sounded great, as it would give me a chance to learn a fourth language, plus be able to work and explore the culture.

We videocalled several times and messaged much more often. A trust relationship was set. I did the paperwork for the visa, got an invitation letter from them, and was set to go. 

I was given a type-D visa for 8 months of multiple entries to the Schengen territory.


It was all going well, when, well, it wasn't. The family never let me join any Polish courses, I was working more than 40 hours a week with just 2 free days a month, and my time outside the house was very restricted. Basically, the opposite to what Au Pairs generally do. There was no contract, just what we had discussed (which was the opposite of what I was doing). But I for a fact knew that there is a time limit of work for Au Pairs, Au Pairs are supposed to attend language courses, and are supposed to have at least 1 free day a week. After 4 months of what seemed like house arrest, I could not take it any longer. I talked with the host-family several times, but they never changed their behaviour. So I took the decision to leave, for my own mental health.

Even though I desperately wanted to, I could not go back to Venezuela at that time, as my family did not have the economic resourses to help me pay a flight back. I still had 4 months left of my Visa, and I still had my return flight ticket for the day my Visa expired (so I had to wait 4 months to leave Poland). I couldn't find any other host families in Poland at that time; if I had, I would have stayed there! I rather loved the country! I ended up finding another seemingly-nice family, this time in Spain, and after talking with the family and leaving in awkward and bitter terms, I left for Spain. 

This time, they truly were nice people. I had the best time and created some of my best memories abroad. I taught English to two lovely kids and made many friends. In all the fun and ""finally able to enjoy my time as an Au Pair,"" I did not realise something. 

I had spent 4 months in Poland, and practically 4 months in Spain. 

While I did have a type-D multiple-entry-to-Schengen-countries Visa, this was a Polish one, not a Spanish one. I'm afraid that did not give me the right to stay more than 90 days in another country that wasn't Poland. I genuinely did not know of this until I was already in Spain, and by that time, it was too late, as I had surpassed the 90-day stay there. I still had a few more weeks left in Spain before my flight back, and no one I knew could host me in Poland for the remaining weeks. 

So I stayed in Spain for the rest of my trip and every day I anticipated the worst. I felt like a criminal; it was not my intention to overstay there, not even to go to Spain in the first place, as I had no idea my experience in Poland would be so bad. But as both are Schengen countries, I had no stamp for Spain on my passport when I arrived or left the country. Just Portugal, as it was my layover stop and first entry to an EU country.

After a few weeks of paranoia and on my last days of my Visa, I flew to Warsaw directly from Spain and took my due return flight (the flight back home was from Poland, since it was expected I'd stay there for the entire time). It was basically as if I had never left the country for the past 8 months. I had my passport stamped in Lisbon (layover stop) when I first arrived to Europe, and had it stamped again in Lisbon (layover stop) while leaving Europe. So I repeat: I did not overstay my Visa period at all, I even entered and left Poland the dates the visa said. However, I did stay in Spain for over 90 days whilst only holding a Type-D visa for Poland. There was no proof of that overstay or that I had even been in Spain at all (though I am sure someone certified could see the track of my flights if they wanted to somehow).

So I returned back to Venezuela and no one said anything, I could pass just fine. 

I still had to wait another year to study in Venezuela, so I considered being an Au Pair again, but this time, taking way more precautions. I was actually invited by the same family in Spain to be an Au Pair, and since they were so nice to me and we got very well along, I agreed. During that process of research for the visa, my family left to the United States (my mum got a job there), but I voluntarily did not go with them, as I still would not be able to go to university there. This is all because I just want to study! 

Later, I found out I couldn't be an Au Pair in Spain, since my native language is already Spanish. Thus, I could not get an Au Pair visa. With no other way to get a visa in Spain to stay for longer than 90 days, I ended up going to Spain for less than 3 months this time. I was very afraid I would not be allowed to enter the country and that somehow the Immigration would know about my previous incident, but it was as if nothing had happened. Since I was staying as a tourist for less than 90 days in Spain this time, I felt less paranoid, as my stay was completely legal that time. 

During that time, my host-family, knowing the tough situation in Venezuela and about my family living somewhere else, offered to host me in Spain if I wanted to study in university there. I had never considered the possibility, and it was already getting too dangerous to live alone in Venezuela, let alone without my family with me. So I very thankfully accepted, and after arriving back to Venezuela in December, we began the whole process to apply for the university in Spain.

That leaves me to right now. I am truly scared that once I turn everything in for the Visa solicitude, I will get my application denied, because of that overstay incident that happened almost a year ago. I mean, my passport stamps are all fine, and I have no recorded incidents in any of the European countries I visited. But I am afraid that the Visa people will somehow look at all the flights I've made (is that possible? would they do that?) and see that little overstay in Spain. I'm afraid I'll get rejected because of that, and worse, fined a huge amount I won't even be able to pay. 

Thus my question: will the incident I just described have any effect on my visa application?","Chances of rejection for my Spanish student Visa? I'm afraid this'll be a bit of a story and a lot of explaining to do, so I appreciate anyone who takes the time to thoroughly read this!

\-Great Nightlife/Activities During the Day, we're not looking for anything super touristy, but more of a ""lets experience this foreign land together"" and it would be great if that foreign land was bustling with things to do, day & nite, whether that be cool cities like Paris and Lisbon or relaxing, retreating places such as Maui and Bali, what are places that you remember never got boring

As I did my research, it seemed that majority of the reviews were people complaining how their luggage was forcefully checked, had to pay a fee, had their luggage lost, or had most of the items inside the bag stolen. I’m kind of freaking out... I’m a girl and if I’m packing my essentials, this includes skincare, makeup, extra shoes etc and the maximum is 10kg. I feel like it wont be enough and I’d have to check my bag eventually... but with all these horror stories I don’t really know what to think. 

A lot of people also complained that they arrived later than expected to SVO, and they ended up missing their second flight. They also said that they had to pay for the ticket, because the employees said that they had more than enough time to get to the gate, so it wasn’t their fault.... but I was told that I’d have to take a shuttle... 

So does anyone here have recent experience with Aeroflot? How was it? Was there any issues with checking your bags and receiving them on time?

b53pfn,travel,"Critique my Itinerary: Florence, Slovenia, Croatia","Planning our Fall trip to Europe and looking for some advise. Sept 27th to Oct 12th

We're starting in Florence, Italy with a group of friends celebrating our 10 year study abroad anniversary. Afterward we'd like to see some new countries we've never been to. We're active outdoorsy people from Colorado. Love hiking, biking, water sports, and nature but also enjoy immersing in new cultures, enjoying good food and drink and experiencing new cities. I know this itinerary is probably trying to cram too much into a short time but I'm having trouble reining it in. My main concern is giving ourselves only a short window for hikes and outdoor activities not taking into account poor weather days. Also, what mode of transportation would you recommend, especially between countries? Renting a car seems nice but also expensive for picking up in one country dropping off in another.

Florence: 3 nights. (non negotiable)

Dolomites: 1 night. We never went up north when we lived in Italy and I hear the mountains are amazing to see and hike plus I'd love to hit up a Prosecco winery for a tasting. Is this long drive/ train from Florence worth it for just 1 night or should we head straight to Slovenia?

Bovec, Slovenia: 2 nights. Hike the Dolomites in the morning and then head to Bovec. Wake up and enjoy a river activity and/or hike.

Lake Bled/ Bohinj: 1 night (worth it to stay here, or should we enjoy the day here and stay in Ljubjlana?

Ljubljana: 1 night. Eat, drink, shop, wander.

Zadar, Croatia: 2 nights. Drive from Ljubljana to Zadar, stopping in Plitvice national park on the way. Nin on day 2.

Sibernik/Skradin: 1 night. Jadrija beach, Krka national park.

Split: 2 nights.  Islands. Will the weather be nice enough for beach time?

Dubrovnik: 2 nights. Island hop, Game of thrones sights (I know cheesy but some of us are fans)

&#x200B;

Let me know your thoughts, accommodation recommendations, etc. Thanks!!

So I'm starting to travel more, having made a return trip to Japan last fall. It was me, my partner and 2 friends. For a 2 week trip we all just took a personal item and a wheeled carry on each in order to save time at the airport and for the convenience. 

It worked great and I loved it! Minimalism while traveling is awesome. 

We're definitely looking to take more trips abroad so now I'm also reconsidering what we use to carry our things.
Like I'm wondering if something like a 35L backpack as a carry-on and a collapsible tote for a personal item might be more convenient? I feel like a backpack might allow for easier travel on public transportation and offer other benefits as well. 

For other minimalist travellers, do you have a preference between the two? How did you decide which carry-on to use?

It will be the first time either of us has been out of the country, so I have a few questions regrading international travel and customs. But first let me show you our itinerary.

&#x200B;

May 21:

\-Fly from Orlando, FL to Manchester overnight, then 2hr layover and fly into Zurich around noon.

\-Nothing in particular, just eat/drink. I already have several places in mind, but open for suggestions. Staying at a hostel with private room/shared bathroom, serves breakfast.

&#x200B;

# Lauterbrunnen

May 22:

\-Train from Zurich to Lauterbrunnen Valley. Nothing in particular planned that day either, just enjoy being there. We will probably get some simple groceries. We booked an Airbnb in Stechelberg for 4 nights.

&#x200B;

May 23:

\-Bernese Alps (Tanzbodeli Hike) Grimmelwald to Stechelberg: I found out about this trail from Reddit, but online resources for the Tanzbodeli route are scarce. I feel comfortable enough to do it, but I would love for someone who has done the trail to chime in. Below is my best approximation of the route (mostly from reading a description of the hike): [https://imgur.com/a/Gq0RmBt](https://imgur.com/a/Gq0RmBt)

[http://www.hikingwalking.com/destinations/sw/sw\_bernese/lauterbrunnen/tanzbodeli/tanzbodeli\_detail](http://www.hikingwalking.com/destinations/sw/sw_bernese/lauterbrunnen/tanzbodeli/tanzbodeli_detail)

This is the only thing we have planned for the day.

&#x200B;

May 24:

\-Junfraujoch Scenic Train: I've always wanted to see a glacier. Coming from Florida, it is probably the most alien landscape I could possibly visit. Gondola from Lauterbrunnen to Wengen, train ride from Wengen to Kleine Scheidegg (9am), check out the weather at Junfrau, and book the ticket up there. I only want to reserve the first leg of the trip in case there is bad weather (tickets are non refundable), any thoughts? I heard there was a good place to eat lunch at Kleine Scheidegg. Only thing planned for the day. We might hang out in Wengen, any good places to eat or drink?

&#x200B;

May 25: This will either be a zero day or a day trip to Bern, depending on our mood. Bern will just be for sightseeing and drinking. Plan on being back in Stechelberg that night.

&#x200B;

May 26: Paragliding at Airtime Paragliding. I am so goddamn excited for this! After we will probably get some coffee at the cafe and head up to murren to eat/drink at the Edelweiss Bar.

&#x200B;

# Zermatt

May 27: Early train from Lauterbrunnen to Zermatt. We will probably hit a grocery store and drop bags at the airbnb, then go sightsee, and then go on a fancy date at Chez Vrony. I have heard good and bad things about this restaurant, and am confused on the best way to get there (looks like uber or walking is the only way). I am open to other suggestions, ideally downtown. Would also love some suggestions for bars/drinks. We have an INCREDIBLE Airbnb booked in Zermatt with a hot tub.... :D

&#x200B;

May 28: Chill day. Enjoy the house, get our money's worth etc. Cook at home. 

&#x200B;

May 29: Matterhorn. I have 2 ideas for this day but I am torn between them. One is the new Crystal Ride thing that they built. IIIIIII don't know how I feel about this one. Seems over the top luxurious, and doesn't even get you close to the mountain. The other is taking Gondolas up to Schwarzee, and hiking the trail to Hornilutte, right at the base of the Marterhorn. The trail is 4 mi. round trip with strenuous uphill, and my fiancee isn't a big hiker, so I'm not sure what to do yet. 

# Morschach

May 30: Train from Zermatt to Lucerne. Rent a car in Lucerne and drive to Airbnb in Morschach. My primary reason for choosing this town is because it is near the Stoos Ridge trail, which will surely be a highlight of the trip. My reason for renting a car is that I don't really have much planned here, and I want the ability to do whatever I want without the confines of train/bus travel. It also allows for a certain logistic pertaining to a hike I want to do, which will be discussed below. We want to get massages on this day but I'm having trouble finding a place. 

&#x200B;

May 31: Stoos ridge hike: [https://imgur.com/a/pF0BdzK](https://imgur.com/a/pF0BdzK). Drive from airbnb to gondola to the east, up to the ridge. Walking sections in blue. We'll probably eat at a pizza place up there.

&#x200B;

June 1: Surenenpass hike. At 8-9 hours, my fiancee probably couldn't make it, so I'll be going alone. She will have the car that day to do whatever she wants, and can pick me up from the end of the hike. [https://imgur.com/a/f0jjo05](https://imgur.com/a/f0jjo05)

&#x200B;

June 2: No plans yet, maybe a day trip to Milan or St Gallen. Open to suggestions.

&#x200B;

June 3: Train back to Zurich, staying right next to airport since flight leaves at 7:05am.

&#x200B;

June 4: Flight to Manchester, 2 hr layover, to Orlando.

&#x200B;

Other information: 

* We are travelling with Osprey Farpoint and Fairway 55L backpacks with detachable daypack. The idea is we can drop the big pack at the place were staying and carry the daypack out.
* We have a Half Fare Card.
* All lodging is already booked

# Questions

* Should we prebook major train tickets? I like the idea of reserving seats, but we might feel rushed at times to get to the train station.
* Junfraujoch train ride, should we book in advance?
* Another note on trains (and busses), I have ZERO experience with public transportation (ashamed suburban American) Is there any etiquette or procedural stuff I should know?
* How much German should I learn? Will I frequently be encountering people who don't speak any English? What language are road signs and menus?
* What's the best app for public transport?
* How is Verizon coverage in Switzerland?
* Are there particulars when it comes to driving? ","Going to Switzerland for honeymoon! Need help/suggestions with itinerary.

I have heard good and bad things about this restaurant, and am confused on the best way to get there (looks like uber or walking is the only way). I am open to other suggestions, ideally downtown. Would also love some suggestions for bars/drinks. We have an INCREDIBLE Airbnb booked in Zermatt with a hot tub.... :D

&#x200B;

May 28: Chill day. Enjoy the house, get our money's worth etc. Cook at home. 

&#x200B;

May 29: Matterhorn. I have 2 ideas for this day but I am torn between them. One is the new Crystal Ride thing that they built. IIIIIII don't know how I feel about this one. Seems over the top luxurious, and doesn't even get you close to the mountain. The other is taking Gondolas up to Schwarzee, and hiking the trail to Hornilutte, right at the base of the Marterhorn. The trail is 4 mi. round trip with strenuous uphill, and my fiancee isn't a big hiker, so I'm not sure what to do yet. 

# Morschach

May 30: Train from Zermatt to Lucerne. Rent a car in Lucerne and drive to Airbnb in Morschach. My primary reason for choosing this town is because it is near the Stoos Ridge trail, which will surely be a highlight of the trip. My reason for renting a car is that I don't really have much planned here, and I want the ability to do whatever I want without the confines of train/bus travel. It also allows for a certain logistic pertaining to a hike I want to do, which will be discussed below. We want to get massages on this day but I'm having trouble finding a place. 

&#x200B;

May 31: Stoos ridge hike: [https://imgur.com/a/pF0BdzK](https://imgur.com/a/pF0BdzK). Drive from airbnb to gondola to the east, up to the ridge. Walking sections in blue. We'll probably eat at a pizza place up there.

&#x200B;

June 1: Surenenpass hike. At 8-9 hours, my fiancee probably couldn't make it, so I'll be going alone. She will have the car that day to do whatever she wants, and can pick me up from the end of the hike. [https://imgur.com/a/f0jjo05](https://imgur.com/a/f0jjo05)

&#x200B;

June 2: No plans yet, maybe a day trip to Milan or St Gallen. Open to suggestions.

&#x200B;

June 3: Train back to Zurich, staying right next to airport since flight leaves at 7:05am.

&#x200B;

June 4: Flight to Manchester, 2 hr layover, to Orlando.

&#x200B;

Other information: 

* We are travelling with Osprey Farpoint and Fairway 55L backpacks with detachable daypack. The idea is we can drop the big pack at the place were staying and carry the daypack out.
* We have a Half Fare Card.
* All lodging is already booked

# Questions

* Should we prebook major train tickets? I like the idea of reserving seats, but we might feel rushed at times to get to the train station.
* Junfraujoch train ride, should we book in advance?
* Another note on trains (and busses), I have ZERO experience with public transportation (ashamed suburban American) Is there any etiquette or procedural stuff I should know?
* How much German should I learn? Will I frequently be encountering people who don't speak any English? What language are road signs and menus?
* What's the best app for public transport?
* How is Verizon coverage in Switzerland?
* Are there particulars when it comes to driving? "
b4zttk,travel,Travel advice—Rishikesh.,"Two things,  First one is the transport from delhi to rishikesh. We’re taking a flight out to delhi and since this is an early morning flight. The flight only reaches delhi at 9.

The second thing is, we’ll have an evening free to explore rishikesh. Probably after river rafting, near ram jhula.

b4zidp,travel,December Honeymoon Travel Questions,"Hi Everyone,

I am in the middle of planning my honeymoon and I’ve been considering many different ideas and I’m struggling with really narrowing down my options so I wanted to see if anyone could provide any insight from their own experiences to help me figure this out.

**Background:**

Our wedding is in mid December and we really want to go on our honeymoon right after the wedding so travel time is about 10 days before Christmas and we are looking to be away for a about a week.

My fiancé has really put the onus on me to plan the whole thing as I do travel quite a bit (even though my travels are primarily limited to Europe and the US) but her only stipulation is that we go somewhere that allows her to relax on the beach. I am pretty open to any type of trip as I can lay around on the beach but I can also do plenty of activities and be on the go. I would like to take a day trip to see some natural or historic sights but I wouldn’t be totally at a loss if we just were bumming around for a week either. We would prefer to stay away from crazy party resorts and prefer more low key bars and restaurants. In an ideal world we could mix having a unique experience somewhere different while still being able to stay at a hotel that would allow to have pool/beach time.

From a budget standpoint, I have about $6,000 in travel rewards that I was hoping to use for my hotel / resort so we can go pretty high end. I was planning on paying for my flight out of pocket but I would be willing to dip into my points if need be. We are traveling from NYC so we have some decent flight options as well.

**Ideas so far:**

Considering the time of year, our location, and my fiancé’s desire for a beach I’ve been focusing on Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. I’ve done a lot of research on different places but I’m traveled to that part of the world so I’m finding it difficult to differentiate between different places. The below are the particular contenders:

**Tulum:**  I love the idea of staying on the beach in a romantic hotel and the ability to take a day trip to see ruins. My fear is that it’s overrun with instagram stars and I don’t truly feel like I’m away.

**Holbox:** Seems more off the beaten path than Tulum but i am slightly concerned is that there is nothing else to.

**Barbados:** similar to Tulum I’m not sure how away from it all id feel and I also don’t know what other activities to do. I am a big fan of rum so I think the distilleries would be a fun day trip but I’m not sure what else there is.

**St. Lucia:** It seems more adventurous than Barbados but I honestly have a hard time distinguishing it from other Caribbean islands. I just see it come up a lot as a popular honeymoon spots.

**Cabo / Todos Santos:** Todos Santos seems like it’s more off the beaten path so that’s intriguing but I’m not sure if the extra travel to get there is worth it.

That’s all the thoughts I have so if anyone has any thoughts on the places I listed or have different places in mind I haven’t mentioned please let me know.

- Food is very expensive, so instead of going out to eat, just buy food at a grocery store and prepare it where you’re staying.
- Do not stay at normal hotels (chains with front desks, parking, etc). Instead stay at Air B&B, regular bed and breakfasts, hostels, etc. Much less expensive.
- Rent a car. Everything is mostly country roads in between establishments in Iceland. I checked the area and it’s really inexpensive.
- Most attractions are free. It’s almost like a large national park over there.

I guess a few questions I had: 
- What is a fair amount of time to spend there to get an experience, at least with consideration to work. I’m sure you could spend months there and still have a ton left. Currently I am in school on some weekends and I work full time. Most importantly, my job doesn’t give me PTO, so I can’t stay for weeks without worry. I want to be there long enough to experience it, but not too long where I get super stressed about being out of work.
- In June, there is no nighttime. Was wondering if I could get advice on functioning there without darkness? I’ve never experienced that, so I have no idea how that affects your body. 
- Any specific attractions that I should make sure I check out?

Any other advice is welcome. Thanks!

b523ep,travel,Best route from Seattle to Casablanca (late August),"Hi! I'll be traveling from Seattle to Casablanca in late August for a 3 week study abroad program. I am instructed to book a one way route to Casablanca since the program ends in Marrakesh, so I can't book a round-trip flight. 
Through my research, I've discovered that there are no direct routes. Therefore I am leaning towards booking two separate flights to get to Casablanca, like to Amsterdam for 3 or 4 days, then to Casablanca. I'm hoping to spend less than ~$600 total to get to Casablanca between the two flights. It looks like the cheapest options from me are to fly into Rekyavik, London, Amsterdam, or Barcelona. 
I am curious if anyone has advice for a good city in late August to spend a few days in (I'm a 19 year old female) before continuing to Morocco? 

Side note:
I've also noticed that there are direct flights from Seattle to the canary islands, and although they aren't the cheapest, it might save me alot of headache since they are near Morocco. Is this a viable route?

b51nxs,travel,Help!! Southeast Asia honeymoon tips needed!,"I've been searching everywhere hoping for good recommendations, but want something a bit more tailored to our tastes, so I'm in desperate need of help!

Trip details: \~3 weeks, probably in october/november (but willing to change for better weather). We'd like to spend half the time on a beach and half the time adventuring around smaller cities.

Specific wants

\- Semi luxury on a well groomed beach to mostly sit around and do nothing/ swim a bit in the water.

\- We want plentiful access to great CHEAP local food within preferably walking distance while we're at our beach location.

\- For cities, we like smaller cities with some cultural flair, but just touristy enough that it's easy to get around and order food. And again, cheap delicious food is huge for us and we want to be able to visit a night market of some kind.

\- I would love to be able to visit gorgeous rice patties/ tea plantations/ etc. or some really cool rain forests. We love to hike and explore a bit off the beaten path.

\- ONE country with all these things, but willing to change hotels 3 times MAX or 2 times with daytrips from the city!

\- We're not hugely into visiting temples or animal refugees, although we'd definitely visit if convenient. (side note that visiting a monastery sounds so cool).

&#x200B;

I appreciate all tips and recommendations! We've been thinking heavily about Vietnam or Thailand, but I recognize there are a few other countries that might be amazing for our honeymoon.

b4vdmv,travel,Driving alone around Europe,"Hey travelers,

This idea is in its infancy still, but I'll see where I get. I've been imagining a month or so of driving around Europe this spring or and summer with occasional camping or sleeping in car (where allowed), coatch surfing, some hiking, and seeing cities. I would probably do it alone unless I find someone to accompany me. I need to be frugal on the way, so camping as much as I can, cooking with own stove, washing in lakes or sea (I'm used to this) so on. Thinking something along the lines of: Southwards of Estonia all the way to Greece via Romania, Serbia, Albania, back via Croatia, Slovenia to Italy, Switzerland and so on. 
I just started to think about this, so I need some planning to do still. Would love to read if you have experience or advice what to consider. 

Also wondering how safe this would be to do alone?  I'd prefer some company but I'm used to solitarity. There's always risks and need to check the insurances of course, driving licence things.","Driving alone around Europe Hey travelers,

I was looking for a spring getaway for a few days to DC and Philly, this April but rates for flights and hotels are up (this is very last minute and poor planning on my end).

b4wime,travel,"Travelling in the EU with a EU passport when you are a EU citizen, but not a resident of the EU?","I'm a dual-citizen with both Canadian & French citizenship and passports, and will be traveling from Canada to Belgium and Czechia (Czech Republic) for tourism for less than 30 days combined. 

Both countries are members of the European Union (EU) and should allow free travel within the EU for EU citizens.

Both countries do NOT require a visa for stays of less than 30 days for Canadians. 

Considering I'm living & working in Canada, and not in France, common sense tells me that I'm better off using my Canadian passport to enter Belgium and Czechia, since I'm planning on returning to Canada and entering Canada with my Canadian passport. 

However, I'm still curious - is there any legal ramifications, risks, consequence or otherwise issue that I should consider in using a French EU passport to enter & travel within the EU, and a Canadian one to return from the same trip and re-enter Canada?

Full disclosure: I would travel with both passports anyway, just in case one gets stolen - and both have the exact sane name, date of birth, etc. My French passport has my Canadian address hard-written in it. Canadian passports do not have any address in it by design.

&#x200B;

I have about a month to spend in Thailand in July.  I'm aware that this is the hot / rainy season in western parts  of the country, so I'm leaving the Andaman sea islands out of the itinerary for now.

I'm going with my girlfriend, so we'll be looking for more laid-back places where possible. Bustling party places like Ko Pha Ngan and Koh Samui are probably off the menu.

One variable we have to take into account is the fact that my girlfriend is extremely motion sick. Day trips into the mountains (Pai is off the menu I'm afraid) etc. are probably not a great idea, and she'll probably be heavily drugged out on any ferries / bus trips.

\- Travel to Trat (bus, 1 day)

b4smfk,travel,"Have only 5 nights in Croatia, how would you spend it across Split, Dubrovnik, and Plitvice National Park? Also how's driving in Croatia?","Been spending the last few hours trying to re-think logistics for my family's trip to Croatia, my old parents and my siblings and myself. We're planning on renting a car, and flying in/out of Zagreb. 

We're already planning on spending very little time in Zagreb, just the first night there to get adjusted to the time, and also the last night before our departing flight since it leaves in the morning.

Option A: I was initially thinking of going straight from Zagreb to Split, spending the day and 1 night there, going to Dubrovnik, spending 2 nights there, then going to Plitvice NP, spending the day there, then heading to Zagreb and spending the last night of the trip there. This option came to mind so that we wouldn't be driving all the way to or from Dubrovnik in a single drive. This leaves us only half a day in Plitvice (or maybe Krka), and I read some Reddit post suggesting to get to Plitvice as early as possible. 

Option B that I thought of: land in Zagreb, spend the night in Zagreb, head to Plitvice and spend the day and night there, head to Split the next day and night there, then go to Dubrovnik and spend 2 nights there, then drive all the way back up to Zagreb to spend the last night there. 

If we decided to go with option A, I don't think we could spend the last night in Plitvice since it's a 2 hour drive to Zagreb and our flight is at 11 am.

Any better plans to do those 3 things (Split, Dubrovnik, and Plitvice National Park)? 

Would Plitvice be super busy in mid May that we should get there as early as possible? Would Krka be a better National Park to visit?

My questions are, can I actually visit universities on my B-2 visa without a ""prospective student"" stamp? Will I be denied entry because the CBP officers might think I intend to adjust my status?

I have a lot of free time on my hands right now,so I was thinking of trying to travel again,cause the itch to do is there.But I am scared that I will give up quickly again and go home after a few days. So I am questioning if I should even try it again. This time I would do it alone, I dont get lonely easily, so I dont mind that. I hope it doesnt make me sound like an asshole,but sometimes with other people I feel like I cant fully relax and I am hoping that travelling alone will be more fun for me.

I'll be traveling to Thaïland for 16 days during the rainy season ( August ) with my girlfriend , and I would like some of your intel about it !
We plan on taking the plane a lot for long distances since we will be squeezed by time.

We plan on visiting : 
- bangkok and region (of course)
- chiang mai and northern region
- an island (ko tao ?)
 
What are your highlights of northern thailand ?
(We might also be interested also in chiang rai and pai )

Is there an island you would suggest more than the other ? Remember that will be in the rainy season and if possible accessible by plane. We enjoy less touristic spots. We heard that koa thao might be best during that time of the year. We like to snorkle and swim.

Whats your absolute highlight about thailand ?
Whats your absolute no-no ? (too touristic , over hyped , non ethical(ex: elephant ride) )

Thanks ! 😀

One thing I think our itinerary may be missing is one or two small town experiences. I would think around Tuscany may be a good place to search, but I'm hoping to get some suggestions! We've saved up a solid travel budget for our honeymoon so were prioritizing experiences over price.

b4otd1,travel,Do you think dedicating 10% of my annual income to 1 large vacation every year is realistic? Am I missing something?,"I'm planning to go to police academy and becoming an officer after I graduate. I can't see myself making much less than 30k as a starting salary. I want to follow the 50/30/20 budget rule.

 It should extremely easy to dedicate 50% of my income to my needs initially. I won't have to pay rent for my first few years because my parents are more than willing to have me continue to live with them. I'm going to take advantage of that until I can't stand not having my own place anymore. My parents will probably continue paying most of my bills as long as I let them as well.  That should make the transition into paying bills myself and eventually renting out a place a smooth process. 


I'll be dedicating at least 20% of my income to retirement, student loans, and an emergency fund. I'll probably be able to dedicate more to that initially with the lack of ""needs"" I'll have. 


In regards to the 30% dedicated towards ""wants"" that shouldn't be difficult for me. I'm extremely cheap. I'm only going to purchase the bare minimum. I'll indulge in hobbies occasionally, but I'll probably have a hard time spending money generally. I think I could easily put aside 10% of that for vacation. 

That would be $3,000 a year for a vacation (assuming my income never improves, which it will). There's a good shot I'll have 15 vacation days and some more paid sick days every year. If I take off as little as possible I'll be able to take a near 2 week long vacation every year. With $3,000 I probably won't be able to go to the more expensive countries, but I could backpack comfortably in places Southeast Asia and China. The ticket would be the greatest expense. When I start making more money I could consider traveling to Europe and such. It seems like this isn't a bad plan to allow for ""frequent"" vacationing throughout my 20s, but I know I'm simplifying a complex situation. Am I missing something? Am I being naive and unrealistic?  Thanks. 

tldr; I'm planning to become a police officer when I graduate. I want my budget to follow the 50/30/20 rule.

I know how to drive a manual pretty comfortably but my boyfriend doesn’t. We like trains because we both enjoy the time to read and hang out instead of having to focus on driving.

How hard are the roads? Any experience in preferring a car vs. using the train for all traveling? And, of course, any recommendations along the way?"
b4kkoa,travel,"Amalfi Coast, best base for lodging and access to transportation?","Hi guys, I have been researching Airbnb and Hotels around the Amalfi Coast area from Atrani to Positano, and everything is quite expensive for our 3 day stay.

I am talking $180+ CAD per night which is stretching my budget as I will be travelling in Italy for about 17 days. 

&#x200B;

Are there any other towns that I might be skipping, how would areas east of Positano be like choosing Serranto as base and taking a ferry everyday to Amalfi Coast towns.

b4n15t,travel,"Critique my itinerary! Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan.","I posted a while back with a general plan/allotment of days. We've finally narrowed down our activities list a bit and would love any last minute tips or critiques regarding the way we've planned the days! We're not the type of people who stick to strict itineraries, so the plans are more like guidelines to make sure we hit up the things we care about the most with options to add more depending on how fast or slow we take it. Leaving in a couple weeks.

**Day 1 (Saturday):** Arrive in Singapore around noon. Hotel is in Chinatown. Check in, walk & eat around the neighborhood at the hawker centres. Don't want to exert ourselves too much after the flight so planning to just wrap up the day by Marina Bay/Gardens for the light shows.

**Day 2 (Sunday):** Start in Little India for breakfast. Head to Kampong Glam to see the mosque and for shopping at Haji Lane, then to Old Airport Road Food Centre. If we have time, go to Orchard Road for even more shopping, then finish up the day in the colonial district with a drink at Raffles perhaps. Art Gallery is on the list if we feel like it. Enjoy nightlife in Clarke Quay.

**Day 3 (Monday):** Go to Orchard Road for shopping if we didn't go the day before, followed by a trip to the Botanic Gardens and Adam Road Food Centre. If we feel up for it, head to Treetop Walk and then the Night Safari. If not, chill out around our hotel area again (and hit up Gardens by the Bay if we were too tired to see them the first night.) 

**Day 4 (Tuesday):** Very early morning flight to Hong Kong. Hotel is in Mongkok. Check in and rest, then slowly explore Kowloon area on foot (Ladies Market, Street Bird Garden, Tsim Sha Tsui.) Either try for an early dinner/drinks at Ho Lee Fook and the Quinary followed by the Victoria Harbour Light Show, or vice versa if we're not hungry that soon. 

**Day 5 (Wednesday):** Take the ferry to Lamma Island for lazy shopping, eating, and hiking. Check out Jumbo Kingdom on the way there or back if it makes sense? Dinner at Juxing Home followed by Cantonese Opera at Ko Shan. 

**Day 6 (Thursday):** Potential day trip to Macau. Eat lots of food and walk around everywhere. Seems like we could start in Taipa and make our way North, or go the other way around. We'll eat egg tarts and African chicken for sure. The famous water show isn't showing during our trip so I don't think we'll stay too late. We don't like gambling so won't spend much time at casinos. I was considering doing the AJ Hackett bungy jump though, if that wouldn't crowd the day too much.

**Day 7 (Friday):** Lantau Island - check out the buddha, Tai O fishing village, and Mui Wo beach? Dinner in Sheung Wan (if we can get the reservation we want!)

**Day 8 (Saturday):** Last day in HK so want to see everything we didn't already see on HK island like Hong Kong Park, shopping in Wan Chai (I've got a few places saved), maybe Shek O beach too? We have a dinner reservation in Wan Chai and will likely go out afterwards. 

**Day 9 (Sunday):** Flight to Kaohsiung mid-morning. Hotel by Liuhe Night Market. Want to check out the Lotus Pond, Pier 2 Art Center, Xinjuejiang Shopping District, and Ruifeng Night Market. 

**Day 10 (Monday):** Train to Tainan (not the HSR.) Hotel close-ish to Tainan Confucious Temple. Don't have much planned here aside from wandering around and eating food. Have considered checking out Taijiang National Park as well.  

**Day 11 (Tuesday):** HSR to Taipei. Hotel by Taipei Main. Not sure what time we will get in - depends on whether or not we want to spend more time in Tainan in the morning. Leaving this day without many plans, maybe just the Huashan 1914 Creative Park followed by Raohe Night Market. If we have extra time we can try to hit up a restaurant on our list that's not particularly near anything else we've planned?

**Day 12 (Wednesday):** Start at Xiahai City God Temple. From there, wander and snack down through Ximendeng all the way to Lungshan Temple. Hang out in Gongguan for a bit (we might do this on Day 1 though if we have time.) Hit up Ningxia Night Market later on if we're still hungry.

**Day 13 (Thursday):** Day trip to Shifen & Jiufen

**Day 14 (Friday):** National Palace Museum, Yangmingshan & Thermal Valley (and Yehliu Geopark? Maybe way too ambitious), Shilin Night Market. It seems like this is a doable, if busy, day. If this is too much we might skip Shilin entirely, or leave the National Palace for its own day. 

**Day 15 (Saturday):** Songshan Cultural and Creative Park, Taipei 101 + Din Tai Fung (we're prepared for the wait!), Maokong Gondola, Tonghua Night Market. 

**Day 16 (Sunday):** Our last day of the trip! Leaving this morning to either revisit somewhere we enjoyed a lot, or hit up an area we missed due to lack of time. Flight home is at 5:30pm.","Critique my itinerary! Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan. I posted a while back with a general plan/allotment of days.

b4k5r2,travel,Americans looking to spend two weeks somewhere cool. Belize? Will it make me as happy as Asia did?,"The three of us are in our mid-twenties, females. We’re all teachers so summer is a must - we’re looking to leave the third week of June and spend two weeks traveling. 

We’re *pretty much* confirmed going to explore Belize for two weeks. We had decided on Guatemala, but one friend had a concern of safety, so we switched locations. We’re supposed to book flight this weekend.

Upon research, Belize seems like a whole lot of beach, which is cool. I also realize there are some ancient ruins to check out, some hiking, and the blue hole... 

The thing is, while Belize looks cool, and I am really looking forward to it, I’m wondering if there’s a more ideal destination for what we’re hoping for. Two years ago, we spent 3 months backpacking in Southeast Asia where the experiences we had there still feel like a dream. Obviously without that amount of time and the diversity of experiences each country has to offer, and it was um, Asia... I do not expect a “similar” experience. 

Let me just tell you what we’re looking for, and you tell me if you have any other suggestions before we book. The girls are very open minded so if I showed them some other options, they’d consider.

- Two weeks ish 
- Affordable for a budget. We’re looking to spend less than $2k (each) including airfare. This is a little flexible. So, most of Europe is out of the question.
- This side of the world. One of the friends is moving to Amsterdam this summer, so she’s saving Europe exploration for a bit later 
- Warm, 80 degrees F or above. I think most of South America will be a bit cold at this time?
- Hiking - somewhat challenging, beautiful, waterfalls
- Other outdoor exploring, kayaking, caving and zip lining is fun
- Cultural experiences - chatting with locals, food, some festivals or markets perhaps
-  Safe
- Meeting travelers was a highlight of our past experiences, but not a must 
- Hostels or home-stays, considering the budget 
- I loved exploring Asia on motorbikes, but this is not at all a must...

What do you think? Do you love Belize? Do you like it? Do you you have other ideas?

Thanks in advance. Feel free to ask questions for clarification. 

Edit: Flying from Philadelphia or DC - depending on price difference ","Americans looking to spend two weeks somewhere cool. Belize? Will it make me as happy as Asia did?

I know that there are a lot of traveling agency , but I don't really trust them. But I do trust reditt.

What are some tips and tricks you could share with a completely nooby traveller.
How early should I look for tickets(most likely flight) and buy them? Is waiting for deals worth it or is it better to just buy them early?( Maybe there is special time for deals like Easter or somthing like that)
I would like to travel to somewhere historic, but still within Europe( As of right now deciding between France and Italy, maybe you now a great town there or something I must see if I travel there). I'm a big foodie and pastry lover, are there any tips for where to look, because as I have noticed( at least for where I live) touristy places have lifted prices.( And also which one would be better for there food France or Italy)
If there is anything you would like to add please do, because I probably forgot something important that you feel I should know.

b4iw4q,travel,10 day family trip to New Zealand in early April,"We are mom and dad travelling with kids aged 10 and 12 - we are arriving in Auckland on March 31st in the late afternoon and leaving from Queensland on April 11th about noon time.

We've checked various travel agency packages and searched reddit for ideas what to see.

We currently live in the middle east so seeing plants and varied landscapes is high on the list.

&#x200B;

Things we've decided that we must see:

* Fox or Franz Josef Glacier
* Haast pass
* Rotorua
* Milford Sound

&#x200B;

Also nice to see:

* Wanaka
* Wai-o-tapu
* Lake taupo
* Milford Sound
* Abel Tasman

 

We couldn't find any flights from Taupo to anywhere in south without flying (back) through Auckland, so the plan is to rent a camper in Auckland, go to Rotorua and either 

\* drive back north to Auckland to fly south to Nelson (or Christchurch and forget Abel Tasman), or

\* drive the camper south and take the ferry to the south island

&#x200B;

We are a little curious about driving - what distance should we count on making?

We read a recommendation not drive after dark in Australia because kangaroos are all over the roads.. Is it safe to drive after dark in NZ? 

How long time would it take to drive the camper from Auckland to the ferry?

How long time would it take to drive from Abel Tasman to Queenstown?

&#x200B;

Is anything missing from the list that we should not miss (given the limited time available)?

Is Wai-o-taupo too much like Rotorua, so it should be skipped?

Is Abel Tasman identical to Milford Sound, so it wouldn't be the end of the world to miss it?

b4fft5,travel,How to properly put a name on a ticket with a Mexican Passport?,"Might be a dumb question and I just might be paranoid but I just bought tickets to Mexico for my parents with AA but I'm starting to have some concerns with the name on ticket vs passport.

The Mexican passport has essentially 3 last names:

* Apellidos: Name1 Name2
* Apelido del conyuge: Name3

How do I translate this to the American airline tickets properly? I set it as:

* First name: Firstname
* Middle name: Name1 Name2
* Last name: Name3

Will this be fine? Everyone says ""it should match the passport"" but this passport is weird since there's two ""surnames"" so I wasn't sure how to match that up. Apparently, when getting this passport my parents said they were advised to not use the ""apellido de conyuge"" and just use the Apellidos: Name1 Name2 names. Did I do this right? Or should I change the names? (Can I even change the name??)

Bonus question: What exactly is the green card number? Is it that number on the back of the card in the format [three letters][10 numbers]? American airlines asks for the card number and wasn't sure what to put.

b4cy21,travel,Baggage without a passenger?,"So I was a bit late for a Monday flight and I missed my baggage drop-off deadline by 5 minutes and I wasn't allowed to drop-off my checked luggage. The front-desk person at check-in said that they aren't allowed to accept anymore baggages for the flight but he said I could Fedex it to my destination or I could check-in my luggage on another flight to the same destination. I would just have to pick up my baggage at the baggage-claim when it arrives. I said ok, cool. He says that the next flight to my destination was Friday, so he tells me to have my friend hold onto my baggage until friday and then check it in before the flight. Alright, sweet.

&#x200B;

So I had my friend just keep the luggage until Friday. I boarded the plane and got to my destination (home), and I called the customer service of the airlines and they confirmed everything that dude said and that I could get my baggage at baggage-claim when it arrives. I just gotta be at the airport when the plane lands.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today (Friday) and my friend brought my baggage to the same airport and tried checking it in but the supervisor tells her that they can't check-in a baggage without a passenger. I talk to the supervisor and he told me they aren't allowed to do it.

&#x200B;

So now I'm pissed, because if I knew that it wasn't allowed then I would have Fedexed the first time! Was the customer service person and the first front-desk person correct? Are they allowed to bring baggage without a passenger? Also it sucks cause I paid for my baggage and i don't think I can get a refund.

b4664q,travel,What would be your top 5 countries to visit if given the opportunity?,"Given the opportunity meaning you were able to visit any country right now without having to worry about visas or financing. I’m a bit bored at the moment and I feel like this is a fun little community question, so feel free to go into as much depth as possible because I’d love a good read later on. 

For me I would probably have to choose; Pakistan, Iran, India, China and maybe Israel. 

 Pakistan: because it’s such a poorly represented country and very misunderstood. Their government has done a good job at fighting extremism in the majority of the country making a big portion of the country now safe for tourists. It’s full of incredible food as you can easily learn more about by watching Mark Wiens on YouTube about his multi episode food tour of Pakistan. The people of Pakistan can be some of the most hospitable. I’d love to visit the historic cities like Karachi and Lahore and I’d love to do some road trip to the mountains in the north. 

Iran: Try the food (again), I really like middle eastern cuisine, or cuisine from the entire MENA region and its history. I’d love to explore some of the incredible mosques in Iran and to again hopefully make it out to the mountains, maybe some of the Iranian islands would be cool too. To explore the historic sites again of course and learn more about their history/museums as I’m really interested in the MENA region for its hospitality, cuisine and history. 

India: I want to explore every region of India, every.single.province. From the mountains in the northwest (Oof) to the mountains in the Sikkim region. The beautiful artitechture and history of Rajasthan. Really want to explore the northeast by motorbike too. 

China: If it were easier to visit Tibet I’d love to do some treks and learn about the Tibetan culture. I’d really like to visit central/western China for the scenery more than the cities. 

Israel: Recently learned that my great uncle was part of UN peacekeeping missions in Israel and all surrounding countries and he left behind a scrap book with some pictures from Jerusalem and Palestine and I’d just love to visit the places he did. Learn about the Israeli and Palestinian history would be pretty neat too because it’s such an old part of the world.

Here are my questions:

&#x200B;

* What geographical reasons (more specifically, the landscape of America itself) made America's railroads (specifically Transcontinental and Baltimore/Ohio) possible and so in 19th century America? And were there other geographic factors that helped (possibly natural resources we had)?

&#x200B;

* Why was the river system of America in 1800's so geographically unique and how was it beneficial to our economy from (1820-1910)?

&#x200B;

* How did America's natural resources lend itself to economic growth in the early 19th century and later on during the industrial revolution (maybe the gold rush could also be included)?

azb32t,geography,Why is North Africa so arid?,"Why doesn't the intertropical convergence zone (INCZ) hover over Northern Africa between May to October? The intertropical convergence zone is a varying zone of high precipitation and strong winds that shift from the Tropic of Capricorn (November to April) to the Tropic of Cancer (May to October). The reason of this change in location is due to Earth's tilted axis -- From May to October, the Tropic of Cancer is exposed to longer daylight hours which creates an air of lower pressure in that area. Denser, colder air from the rest of the world tends to gravitate to the Tropic of Cancer in this period which also carries sea breezes. Hence, the Tropic of Cancer receives high precipitation from May to October and is drier for the rest of the year (Meanwhile, the Tropic of Capricorn experiences high precipitation). Seeing that monsoonal India and a few other areas (Indochina, Southeastern China) experiences high precipitation from May to October because they are located in the Tropic of Cancer, why doesn't Northern Africa, which is located similar in latitude to the aforementioned areas, experience downpours in that same period?

&#x200B;

One hypothesis is that the lack of any large water bodies in Northern Africa results in lesser sea breezes/convectional precipitation but that doesn't really explain how all the large trade winds seem to be ""repelled"" by Northern Africa (See the video below). It doesn't seem like land mass has much of an effect on the likelihood of winds passing through, either. South America has a rather large land mass and yet its monsoonal regions still actually experience monsoons.

[https://youtu.be/qh011eAYjAA](https://youtu.be/qh011eAYjAA)

&#x200B;

Perhaps this (The ""repulsion"" in the video above) is because of the mountain ranges along Northeast Africa that might be blocking off winds (Trade winds blow westwards). However those mountains (especially the really north ones like Egypt) aren't even that high. Much of the mountains in Egypt are \~1500m but clouds can go as high as 6000m. What's going on?

&#x200B;

You can really see this taking place in that video I sent. Notice how the winds tend to not go over the Nepal mountain ranges because they are so high (4000-8000m).","Why is North Africa so arid?

Published on Feb 28, 2019

The 2015-2016 El Niño event brought weather conditions that triggered regional disease outbreaks throughout the world, according to a new NASA study that is the first to comprehensively assess the public health impacts of the major climate event on a global scale.   El Niño is an irregularly recurring climate pattern characterized by warmer than usual ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific, which creates a ripple effect of anticipated weather changes in far-spread regions of Earth. During the 2015-2016 event, changes in precipitation, land surface temperatures and vegetation created and facilitated conditions for transmission of diseases, resulting in an uptick in reported cases for plague and hantavirus in Colorado and New Mexico, cholera in Tanzania, and dengue fever in Brazil and Southeast Asia, among others.

ay84ur,geography,Seeking Advice on Graduate Education in Geography/GIS,"Hey r/geography, I'm hoping you can provide me with some advice and anecdotes on pursuing graduate school in geography. 

I'm currently about 1 year out of undergrad and work in consulting for a major firm, focused on procurement/supply chain management. It pays well but I really don't enjoy it at all, and am looking to change fields into something more geography-focused ASAP. 

Ideally, I'd love to be a GIS analyst for a real estate firm as that combines many of my interests. So, I'm looking for advice on the best way to make that happen. 

During my undergrad I was able to complete a BA in Earth science in addition to a BS in supply chain, so I fortunately have several courses in Remote Sensing under my belt. My direct experience with GIS, though, is limited to a small self-led research project where I used ArcGIS for some basic maps (my school had no GIS courses for whatever reason.) I also unfortunately have very limited programming experience. I'm trying to determine what would be the best course of action for me to pursue my dream jobs in geography/GIS, and have laid out a few options: 

-Complete GIS Certifications on Coursera or another other online program (Not sure if this could lead to the jobs I want. Also, I plan on quitting my current job to pursue this as I have some savings and want to fully immerse myself. So, I don't necessarily need the part-time flexibility, though it would be nice)

-Earn a grad certificate in GIS at a university in-person (seems relatively cheap and pretty quick, but not sure about the breadth of job opportunities, and if it's worth the premium over online programs. However, I could maybe apply the credits to a masters later-on in geography or another field like urban planning or an MSRED if I choose to pursue that) 

-Get a masters in GIS or Geoinformatics (More expensive and immersive. Would be much more of a long-term commitment but I think would yield the best job opportunities and would give me valuable programming skills)

-Get an MA in geography (would allow me to explore my passion in geography more while still learning GIS, but seems less marketable while still being the same price as a GIS-focused degree, and wont give me as many useful programming skills)

I would love to hear from people who have gone down one of these paths and how it's worked out for you. I appreciate all advice and perspectives! Thanks in advance. 

TL;DR: Seeking advice and anecdotes on graduate education in geography/GIS from those who have been through it.

axkzeo,geography,Why are some icebergs green? I AGU," Published on Mar 4, 2019

Researchers have proposed a new idea that may explain why some Antarctic icebergs are tinged emerald green rather than the normal blue, potentially solving a decades-long scientific mystery.   Pure ice is blue because ice absorbs more red light than blue light. But since the early 1900s explorers and sailors have reported seeing peculiar green icebergs around certain parts of Antarctica.   The green icebergs have been a curiosity to scientists for decades, but now glaciologists report in a new study that they suspect iron oxides in rock dust from Antarctica’s mainland are turning some icebergs green. They formulated the new theory after Australian researchers discovered large amounts of iron in East Antarctica’s Amery Ice Shelf.

https://i.redd.it/wxx4yn01sqj21.jpg

Perhaps you've heard the recent news about the current fighting between India and Pakistan in the Kashmir region. It all began when a man named Cyril Radcliffe drew some arbitrary lines on a map.

&#x200B;

Summary on Wikipedia:

 

>Radcliffe, a man who had never been east of Paris,[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Radcliffe,_1st_Viscount_Radcliffe#cite_note-1) was given the chairmanship of the two boundary committees set up with the passing of the [Indian Independence Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Independence_Act_1947).  He was faced with the daunting task of drawing the borders for the new nations of [Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan) and [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India)  in a way that would leave as many Hindus and Sikhs in India and Muslims  in Pakistan as possible. Radcliffe submitted his partition map on 9  August 1947, which split [Punjab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Province_(British_India)) and [Bengal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal)  almost in half. The new boundaries were formally announced on 14 August  1947 — the day of Pakistan's independence and the day before India  became independent of the United Kingdom.   
>  
>Radcliffe's efforts saw some 14 million people — roughly seven  million from each side — flee across the border when they discovered the  new boundaries left them in the ""wrong"" country. In the violence that  ensued after independence, estimates of loss of life accompanying or  preceding the partition vary between several hundred thousand and two  million[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Radcliffe,_1st_Viscount_Radcliffe#cite_note-FOOTNOTETalbotSingh20092-2)[\[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Radcliffe,_1st_Viscount_Radcliffe#cite_note-3),  and millions more were injured. After seeing the mayhem occurring on  both sides of the boundary, Radcliffe refused his salary of 40,000  rupees (then 3,000 pounds). He was made a [Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Grand_Cross_of_The_Order_of_the_British_Empire) in 1948.

ar2qg6,geography,"Is there taiga in the lower 48 states of USA, particularly Montana, or Yellowstone?","Most of the biome maps I found don't show any, but the yellowstone website says that yellowstone is a taiga mostly.

Edit:

I found another map that shows extensive taiga coming into USA, almost all the way to Mexico.

This seems hard to believe to me, I always linked taiga in my mind with colder climates mainly. 
I know it is linked with extreme tempurature change,  but is there some other reason why they could classify so much as taiga?


Also someone downvoted me apparently.

Conservation work is equally as great and has real significance behind it, but I feel like I get caught up in the paperwork/administrative/legislative and low-pay side of it.

Part of me feels like the draw is just being back in school and the research/field work aspect of education is appealing.  Would my options be drastically advanced post-graduate or would I just find myself looking at the same jobs, just with debt this time?

Ideally, my career would consist of a decent-paying, semi field involved, job that has significance behind it.

As Syria, Lebanon used to be under a French mandate after WWI, which is a different status from colonies. After decolonisation, the French territories spared from the process where gathered in the name of overseas departments and regions of France (DROM). Even if Lebanon won its independence in 1943 from the French, it seems to me that, geographically speaking, it still shares lot of characteristics with the DROM.

Indeed, except from French Guyana, Lebanon has an high density (587/sq.m, Mayotte :  566, Martinique :  344, la Réunion :  334, Guadeloupe :  248 ) but empty spaces and therefore highly populated area in the riverside. In particular it has an hypertrophied capital : Beirut, 2.5 million of inhabitants. Furthermore, like every DROM its economy lies mainly on tourism. Moreover, its .Last, unfortunately, it has a long tradition of social and political unrest and migration, since the beginning of the war in Syria one million refugees have come from there. In comparison one can think about Mayotte for the immigration and New Caledonia for the unrest.

Yet the hypertrophied capital is different as far in the DROM they seems to be an umbilical cord with the metropolis where there is no metropolis to be linked to. Furthermore, Lebanon seems to be largely inserted in its *regional area*, the space whose components have in common specificities related to their geographical proximity and which develop relations with them. Especially Middle East seems to be quite a specific one. Indeed, countries from Syria to Saudi Arabia and Iran tries to mingle whereas the DROM seems to be left alone, only linked to their metropolis. Religion seems to be quite an important geographical compass for Lebanon and to distinguish it from the DROM. And even if the DROM are quite inequals, Lebanon has a very specific separations into three main communities that actually can be numbered up to eighteen.

&#x200B;

I'm trying to divide the world into 64 roughly equal parts.  I know there are many, many ways the world can divide, and am looking for a family resemblance.  The obvious quantifiable stats I could use were land area, GDP, and population.  I took each nation's (yes, I used national boundaries at this point.  I know it's imperfect but was a good schelling point and made for easier information processing at this stage) percentage of global \_\_\_, added them, and overweighted each's best ranking of the three for smoothing.  I then combined any obvious combinations from the bottom of the list into others until I got to 64ish at 1/64 of the combined total.  Some countries occupied more than one ""point.""

&#x200B;

The math was, I believe, a good starting point, but not yet a least acceptable answer.  I took one point off the top of India, China, and USA for further smoothing, but there were still problems.  An example even obvious to me, as someone extremely ignorant of geography, was that Turkey occupied two slots.  That seemed wrong.  Sadly I did not log the combinations into Turkey that caused the error.  Part way through I at least started counting how many joins with +s.  I was also tempted to artificially bump New Zealand up, but I think it may have just been a ""I've heard f that one a bunch of times!"" bias and did not.

&#x200B;

Here are my 64.  I welcome all input on the matter.  I know the internet's favorite response to ""How do I X?"" is always ""Don't worry!  You don't have to X at all!"" but while I'll read that kind of non-answer, I'll actually pay attention if there's also something useful with it.  Even one ""join these two"" or ""Split this one"" can be helpful, regardless of whether it retains the 64 unit total.  Someone else might have a join with no split to offset your split with no join.

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance, if anyone finds my asanine project interesting or entertaining enough to help out.  Don't hate me for getting this wrong; I'm sure some part of it is laughable and/or rage inducing to people who know things.

I have two degrees, a BS in forestry (with a minor in wildlife biology) and a masters in forestry, with an emphasis on water quality. I’m also a certified arborist via the International Society of Arboriculture. I currently work for a University doing Extension work (like the old school County Agent, but specializing in forestry) which means I mostly teach professional foresters (we have to take continuing education classes to maintain our professional license), but I also do some research and every now and then I get to get my boots muddy and do some traditional “dirt forestry” in the woods.

A note on my user name: In forestry school, there is a little friendly rivalry between the students majoring in traditional forestry and the students doing wildlife. The forestry guys refer to the wildlife guys as “Bunny Sheriffs” and they referred to us as “Timberbeasts.” I’m a big guy, and one time doing some field exercises I cleared the brush through a trail for a bunch of students and they started calling me “THE Timberbeast.” I’ve even got a beer named after me from Lazy Magnolia for some work I did helping them lobby the state legislator a few years back. It’s delicious and you should try it (if you like big, hoppy rye IPAs).

So here I am, ready to answer any of your questions on forestry, trees, plant succession, prescribed forest fire, wood products, (or even craft beer and beer laws), hydrology, maps, migration, and how to apply geographic and GIS knowledge in a career.

ahh0rw,geography,What do you think are the different cultural regions of Canada ?,"This is a topic I'm always trying to gauge as a Canadian. For the most part Canada is normally considered as not having any cohesive culture which I believe to be overall true for various reasons. I definitely subscribe to regionalism however, which is more of a pan-north american concept but I think you can definitely identify distinct Canadian cultural regions. I would say they are: the maritimes, Newfoundland, southern Quebec, the west coast, the prairies. I don't know what to do about Ontario, however. Southern Ontario or more specifically the Golden Horse Shoe can kind of be considered ""general canadian"" due to it being the most highly multicultural region of Canada. So then maybe northern and southern Ontario could be their own cultural regions ? Anyway the last one would be the north very broadly. Including the territories and the north of most of the provinces (the parts covered by the boreal forest basically). What are other people's thoughts on this ? Anyone agree or disagree ? I'm also aware that there are deeper regional variations within those I just mentioned. For example, central Ontario and a lot of the rural parts of southern and northern Ontario has a sort of hillbilly culture and their own vernacular, equivalent maybe to Appalachia in the US. Also, speaking as an anglophone Quebecer from Montreal I would definitely count Montreal as culturally distinct from the rest of Quebec and then go even further to say that the Montreal Anglo community is distinct from the overlying Montréalais but also vaguely distinct from the rest of english Canada. Within Quebec I would also be tempted to say that Gaspésie and Saguenay-Lac Saint Jean are also distinct cultural regions as the people from these places often identify themselves as being from that region before being Québecois. I think the same goes to Acadians in the Maritimes for the most part.","What do you think are the different cultural regions of Canada ? This is a topic I'm always trying to gauge as a Canadian. For the most part Canada is normally considered as not having any cohesive culture which I believe to be overall true for various reasons. I definitely subscribe to regionalism however, which is more of a pan-north american concept but I think you can definitely identify distinct Canadian cultural regions. I would say they are: the maritimes, Newfoundland, southern Quebec, the west coast, the prairies. I don't know what to do about Ontario, however. Southern Ontario or more specifically the Golden Horse Shoe can kind of be considered ""general canadian"" due to it being the most highly multicultural region of Canada. So then maybe northern and southern Ontario could be their own cultural regions ? Anyway the last one would be the north very broadly. Including the territories and the north of most of the provinces (the parts covered by the boreal forest basically). What are other people's thoughts on this ? Anyone agree or disagree ?

abw4eu,geography,Geosim: A text-based geopolitical roleplaying game,"*Thanks to the moderators of /r/geography for allowing us to do this.*  
  
Geosim is a modern-age geopolitical simulator based around ideas of a moderation between realism and enjoyment. Anyone can come around and claim a country and, with sufficient build-up, take it anywhere they please (within the bounds of reality). We pride ourselves on having an open and welcoming community in the form of our discord, which is always ready to help out any fledgling member ready to jump on in and build themselves a future for whatever spot on the globe they desire.
  
###Frequently Asked Questions  
  
*Feel free to ask more specific questions if you’re confused about one thing or the other*  
  
**What is the scope of my claim?**  
  
The standard answer to the question is “whatever the government can do, you can do”, but generally it is a bit more lenient than that. Roleplay posts, predominantly political, are allowed. One can also dictate rises in popularity of one party/ideology or another. Terrorist cell creation is where it starts to get questionable, so whether its allowed is a case-by-case basis. Dictating the actions of other countries in response to what you do is not allowed at all, and is done by a moderator (if its an NPC) or the player claiming the country.  
  
**How crazy can I get?**  
  
Realism is of great value in Geosim. You can’t simply buy an aircraft carrier as Nigeria, or, as Brazil, declare war on Paraguay because they begin to lean towards Argentina more. In order to preserve the sanctity of the simulation, some actions will be outright invalidated (a move usually reserved for the worst of the worst), and some actions will need significant build-up in order to get anywhere (stuff like civil wars or elections of new parties).
  
**How does economics as a whole work?**  
  
Every country makes a budget, which is either class III or class IV, based on the complexity one wants (class IV deals with debt more directly while class III is more simplified). The standard source for numbers is the IMF databank.  
  
As for international economics, we (try to) make posts showing regional growth trends, the business cycle, recessions, and other things. Our economic moderators inform you of how your economic policies should affect things on your budget, and also ensure you’re not doing anything absolutely horrible that will make your entire economy fall apart in seconds.  
  
**How does the UN work?**  
  
The UNSC and the UNGA are independent and treated as such. All countries can submit UNGA resolutions, but only countries in the UNSC can submit/sponsor UNSC resolutions. UNSC members, besides the permanent members, are chosen at random. There’s no weekly (or ig yearly) megapost for the UN, one simply submits a resolution like any other post.  
  
**What’s a ModEvent?**  
  
Its an event made by moderators to spice things up. They can feature natural disasters, political unrest, punishments for doing stupid things that aren’t stupid enough to invalidate, and just about anything you can think of, within reason.  
  
**Expansions?**   
  
Expansions are one of the few moderator-sanctioned concessions of realism in geosim. They allow countries to annex other countries, or form a union. The system isn’t incredibly complicated, but it takes some work, depending on the difficulty values assigned to you for a particular expansion. There are limits to it, though. Really stupid expansions aren’t allowed (you can’t annex Somalia as Guatemala). Historically prevalent expansions are usually the most common, alongside things such as the European Federation and Korea.  
  
**How do wars work?**  
  
Wars are pretty simple. All sides get time to make conflict posts detailing their plans. If one side doesn’t make a conflict post moderators create their own battle plan for them. Moderators then take both sides and curate how each offensive goes, and sums all that up in a battle post.  
  
Civil wars can work differently. If a player so desires, moderators allow them to make their own battle posts detailing how the civil war goes in their own country. Moderators check to see if anything is stupid, and if nothing is stupid, then the battle post is officially endorsed.  
  
**How long are posts, usually?**  
  
It depends. Newer people usually submit about one paragraph or two, and once they see some of the longer posts submitted by seasoned players, they gradually make their posts longer. An average post length would be around 400-600 words, with longer posts stretching to 1,000 words and beyond (Don’t worry, there’s no pressure to write an essay with each post. Go at your own pace).  
  
  **What is rollme?**  
  
Rollme is a dice rolling bot that is mainly used for secrecy and expansion posts, but can also be used for whatever the player wants it to do. You can find a guide for its use [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/wiki/rollme). There are also more complex guides found [here](https://wiki.roll20.net/Dice_Reference).  
  
**How do secrecy posts work?**  
  
Secrecy posts are divided into two types: Ones that requires rolls and ones that do not. The latter usually refers to roleplay posts that the player doesn’t want people to know about. The former refers to the really fun ones, where secret operations are conducted. For the former, a moderator gives the player a roll through rollme that the player has to succeed in. If they don’t, the operation fails. Other countries can request discovery rolls on the operation, and there is also a standard discovery roll that all secrecy posts undergo.  
  
There was recently an introduction of complexity with the new discovery roll choices between SIGINT and HUMINT, the cover-up roll, and the bloc discovery roll, which can be read about on our [secrecy wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/wiki/secrecy). This whole area is still in development so you can expect some change to come out if you join up.

**What are application countries?**  
  
Application countries require an application. They are composed of the P5, India, and Japan. When there are no applicants for a set amount of time they can be claimed like any other country.  
  
**How do I get a flair?**  
  
You should only do this when you claim a country. Near the top of the sidebar there is text that says “Show my flair on this subreddit. It looks like:” and then shows your username and (edit). Click on edit. Find the flag of your country. Click on it, and save it. If you’re on mobile you can’t do that, so ask a mod and they’ll do it for you.  
  
**What’s the timescale?**

If you guys could give me some suggestions or point me in a direction that would be amazing!! I don't have any experience in coursework with public health or health geography, so I am mostly looking for books that would be fitting for an undergrad student that is just dipping their feet into this topic. My advisor already gave me Global Health by Kathryn Jacobsen, A Critical Introduction to Health Geographies, An Introduction to Global Health Delivery, To Repair the World, Infections and Inequalities, and Pathologies of Power. The topics that I am interested in are: Disease Ecology, Environmental Health/Justice, Epidemiology, Infectious and Chronic Diseases, Global Health, Nutrition, Health Policy, Maternal and Child Health, Minority Health, Immigration, and Refugee Health.

a93wj7,geography,Is there any reason besides the Canadian Shield that North America's major lakes follow such a straight diagonal line?,"So, excepting the obvious (Great Salt Lake, Nicaragua, you know) I noticed something about North America's major bodies of water as a kid I've never been able to un-see: Why are so many of them in such a relatively straight path, northwest to southeast?

&#x200B;

If you're wondering what I'm talking about, pull up a globe or map of choice and put your finger on Liverpool Bay/the Eskimo Lakes, near the mouth of the Anderson River in Canada. Trace your finger southeast to Great Bear Lake, and take notice it passes by the largest bodies of water between Bear and the northern coast-- the cluster centered around Colville Lake. Heading southeast again to Great Slave Lake through Tlicho Land again passes some of that region’s largest and most well-defined lakes— Hotta, Grandin, Faber and Lac la Martre. Staying the course brings you past Athabasca, Cree, Lac La Ronge and the southwestern tips of Reindeer and Wollaston Lakes to Cedar, Moose, Winnipeg and Winnipegosis.

From there on it’s the Lake of the Woods, and then, finally, the Southwestern portions of Great Lakes Superior and Michigan. If you retrace the entire route with the slightest of curves eastward, it’ll carry you through these lakes, over the Appalachians and hundreds more miles southeast to… Chesapeake Bay, one of the largest estuaries on the continent.

&#x200B;

Obviously, these are just a few of North America’s bodies of water, but notice how they’re some of the largest and most well defined? The further you travel toward central Canada, the more ribbony and ill-defined its lakes become— Dubawnt and Baker lakes are some of the few lakes this far out on the Canadian Shield easily identifiable from a comparable distance.

Admittedly the Canadian Shield must play a big part in all this, with its borders hewing right up against the those of of the biggest lakes from Bear on down, particularly Winnipeg and Superior. Athabasca and its southeastern neighbors are where things get weird— it, Wollaston, Reindeer and La Ronge are all on the narrowest western part of the Shield. And hydrologically, the area starts to break up as well— rather than draining along the Mackenzie River Basin, water instead flows eastward through the Hudson Bay and Nelson River watersheds (which I guess are two distinct things despite the ending up in the same destination). Then you’ve got the St. Lawrence River watershed, again draining away in a totally different direction, albeit one that in tandem with the Shield probably explains why the Great Lakes are relatively offset.

&#x200B;

So if the Canadian Shield has a palpable effect on the makeup of most lakes on it and there’s multiple watersheds draining the continent’s water away in multiple directions anyway, how come its major lakes still form such a well-defined trajectory? Is it a holdover from major glacial activity across the continent? A mix of factors? Is there a name or some kind of serious discussion about this phenomenon? Is it a coincidence? Am I insane? Answer as many of these as you wish.

EDIT: Upon consulting maps of prehistoric lakes Agassiz and McConnell and the Laurentide Ice Sheet roughly around the time of the Younger Dryas cold epoch, they also follow about the same curvature. Could it be a result of the Laurentide Ice Sheet carving a strike-slip pattern into the lowlands of the North American Cordillera back in the day?","Is there any reason besides the Canadian Shield that North America's major lakes follow such a straight diagonal line?

a73rob,geography,I'm a new geography major who will be graduating this year. Should I look for internships first or can I still apply for full time jobs?,"So after 3.5 of torturing myself as a Computer Science major, I dropped the major last year and went into Geographic, a major more aligned with my interests. During my time as a Computer Science major, I took a few geography classes just out of interests and because of that, I am going to finish my geography degree in one year this year. 

As winter break approaches and I start job hunting for next year, I can't decide if I want to do an internship first or go a full time position. I'm going to be specializing in GIS and was able to take courses on it so I'm familiar with the ArcGIS software. But I'm not sure whether I have enough experience to work full time with it. Just also to note, even though I was a Computer Science major, I did extremely poorly in the subject and retain no info from what I learned. I pretty much have no programming experience and do not wish to do a programming based job.

Even though new with GIS, should I still try to apply for full time positions after graduation or will it be better for me to do an internship first? Also, what are some geography related skills and certifications I can learn that would look good on a resume?","I'm a new geography major who will be graduating this year.

* 95033's preferred place name is Los Gatos, however it does not overlap the Los Gatos city limits at all and a big chunk of it is actually in neighboring Santa Cruz County. It also covers a lot of the area around Saratoga, even parts that are very close to Saratoga and very far from Los Gatos.
* 94550 does cover part of its PPN of Livermore, however it extends strangely far south into neighboring Santa Clara County near Mt Hamilton.
* 94608 covers the whole city of Emeryville, but to much local confusion also includes parts of Oakland and I think also parts of Berkeley
* Perhaps most famously, 90210 covers not only the whole city of Beverly Hills, but also a neighborhood in the city of Los Angeles known as ""Beverly Hills Post Office"".
* Los Altos and Los Altos Hills split both of their zip codes.
* The cities of Colma and Brisbane both share their only zip code with Daly City.

I'm sure there's a lot more than this. I'm sorry if this is boring but it really fascinates me.","Weird zip codes in California This is the silliest thing ever, I don't see any subreddit rules so I'm sorry if I'm breaking them.Here are some zip code oddities in California:

There is a society to the east, on the mountain, and another one to it´s left (near the lake). Historically, both are situated in the middle age (no guns, most advanced weapon is a cannon and it´s on the other side of the world), and had wars with the society of the mountain.

1. They say that North and South America are two different continents.

I even had the idea to make it a podcast. However, my life is busy and it's hard to keep it active and post regularly. I want the page to be much more active than it currently is. I was wondering if anyone on this subreddit would be interested in helping me run the page.

Lately, I've been posting mostly geography related memes stolen from Reddit. While memes are cool, I want this to be a much more serious page that gets people talking and thinking about things spatially and geographically. Does that interest anyone?
